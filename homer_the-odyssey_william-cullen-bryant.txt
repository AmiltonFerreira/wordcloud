Preface


			The kind reception which my translation of the Iliad has met with from my countrymen has encouraged me to attempt a translation of the Odyssey in the same form of verse. I have found this a not unpleasing employment for a period of life which admonishes me that I cannot many times more appear before the public in this or any other manner. The task of translating verse is not, it is true, merely mechanical, since it requires that the translator should catch from his author somewhat of the glow with which he wrote, just as a good reader is himself moved by the words which he delivers, and communicates the emotion to his hearers; yet is the translator spared the labor of invention﻿—the task of producing the ideas which it is his business to express, as well as that of bringing them into their proper relations with each other. A great part of the fatigue which attends original composition, long pursued, is therefore avoided, and this gentler exercise of the intellectual faculties agrees better with that stage of life when the brain begins to be haunted by a presentiment that the time of its final repose is not far off.

			Some of the observations which I have made, in my Preface to the Iliad, on that work and the translation which I have made of it, apply also to the Odyssey and to the version which I now lay before the reader. The differences between the two poems have been so well pointed out by critics, that I shall have occasion to speak of but two or three of them. In executing my task, I have certainly missed in the Odyssey the fire and vehemence of which I was so often sensible in the Iliad, and the effect of which naturally was to kindle the mind of the translator. I hope that the version which I have made will not on that account be found lacking in a sufficient degree of spirit and appearance of freedom to make it readable. Another peculiarity of the Iliad, of a less agreeable nature, consists in the frequent recurrence of hand-to-hand combats, in which the more eminent warriors despatch, by the most summary butchery, and with a fierce delight in their own prowess, their weaker adversaries. These incidents so often occur in the narrative, being thrown together in clusters, and described with an unsparing minuteness, that I have known persons, soon sated with these horrors, to pass over the pages in which they are described, and take up the narrative further on. There is nothing of this kind in the Odyssey, at least until near the close, where Ulysses takes a bloody vengeance on the suitors who have plundered his estate, and conspired to take the life of his son, and in that part of the poem the horror which so enormous a slaughter would naturally awaken is mitigated by the recollection of their guilt. The gods of the Odyssey are not so often moved by brutal impulses as those of the Iliad, nor do they seem to dwell in a sphere so far removed from the recognition of those rules of right and wrong which are respected in human society. In the composition of the two poems, one of the most remarkable differences is the abundance of similes in the Iliad, and their comparatively rare appearance in the Odyssey. In the Iliad the desire of illustrating his subject by a similitude sometimes seizes the poet in the midst of one of the most interesting parts of his narrative, and immediately there follows a striking picture of some incident bearing a certain resemblance to the one which he is relating. Sometimes, after one simile is minutely given, a second suggests itself, and is given with equal minuteness, and there is one instance at least of a third. It is curious to mark what a fascination the picturesque resemblance of objects and incidents has for the poet, and how one set of these images draws after it another, passing in magnificent procession across the mirror of his imagination. In the Odyssey are comparatively few examples of this mode of illustration; the poet is too much occupied with his narrative to think of them. How far this point of difference between the two poems tends to support the view of those who maintain that they could not have proceeded from the same author, is a question on which it is not my purpose to enter.

			In the Preface to my version of the Iliad, I gave very briefly my reason for preserving the names derived from the Latin, by which the deities of the Grecian mythology have hitherto been known to English readers﻿—that is to say, Jupiter, Juno, Neptune, Pluto, Mars, Venus, and the rest, instead of Zeus, Herè, and the other names which are properly Greek. As the propriety of doing this is questioned by some persons of exact scholarship, I will state the argument a little more at large. The names I have employed have been given to the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece from the very beginnings of our language. Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, and the rest, down to Proctor and Keats﻿—a list whose chronology extends through six hundred years﻿—have followed this usage, and we may even trace it back for centuries before either of them wrote. Our prose writers have done the same thing; the names of Latin derivation have been adopted by the earliest and latest translators of the New Testament. To each of the deities known by these names there is annexed in the mind of the English reader﻿—and it is for the English reader that I have made this translation﻿—a peculiar set of attributes. Speak of Juno and Diana, and the mere English reader understands you at once; but when he reads the names of Herè and Artemis, he looks into his classical dictionary. The names of Latin origin are naturalized; the others are aliens and strangers. The conjunction and itself, which has been handed down to us unchanged from our Saxon ancestors, holds not its place in our language by a firmer and more incontestable title than the names which we have hitherto given to the deities of ancient Greece. We derive this usage from the Latin authors﻿—from Virgil, and Horace, and Ovid, and the prose writers of ancient Rome. Art as well as poetry knows these deities by the same names. We talk of the Venus de Medicis, the Venus of Milo, the Jupiter of Phidias, and never think of calling a statue of Mars a statue of Ares.

			For my part, I am satisfied with the English language as it has been handed down to us. If the lines of my translation had bristled with the names of Zeus and Herè, and Poseidon and Ares, and Artemis and Demeter, I should feel that I had departed from the immemorial usage of the English tongue, that I had introduced obscurity where the meaning should have been plain, and that I had given just cause of complaint to the readers for whom I wrote.

The Odyssey





						Book 						I


					Visit of Pallas to Telemachus


				 				A council of the gods﻿—Deliberations concerning Ulysses﻿—Mercury despatched to Calypso, to bid her send Ulysses to Ithaca﻿—Visit of Pallas, in the shape of Mentor, to Telemachus, advising him to repair to Pylos and Sparta in quest of his father, Ulysses﻿—Revels of the suitors of Penelope﻿—Phemius, the minstrel, and his song of the return of the Grecians﻿—The suitors rebuked by Telemachus.





				Tell me, O Muse, of that sagacious man

				 				Who, having overthrown the sacred town

				 				Of Ilium, wandered far and visited

				 				The capitals of many nations, learned

				 				The customs of their dwellers, and endured

				 				Great suffering on the deep: his life was oft

				 				In peril, as he labored to bring back

				 				His comrades to their homes. He saved them not,

				 				Though earnestly he strove; they perished all,

				 				Through their own folly; for they banqueted,

				 				Madmen! upon the oxen of the Sun﻿—

				 				The all-o’erlooking Sun, who cut them off

				 				From their return. O goddess, virgin-child

				 				Of Jove, relate some part of this to me.



			 				Now all the rest, as many as escaped

				 				The cruel doom of death, were at their homes

				 				Safe from the perils of the war and sea,

				 				While him alone, who pined to see his home

				 				And wife again, Calypso, queenly nymph,

				 				Great among goddesses, detained within

				 				Her spacious grot, in hope that he might yet

				 				Become her husband. Even when the years

				 				Brought round the time in which the gods decreed

				 				That he should reach again his dwelling-place

				 				In Ithaca, though he was with his friends,

				 				His toils were not yet ended. Of the gods

				 				All pitied him save Neptune, who pursued

				 				With wrath implacable the godlike chief,

				 				Ulysses, even to his native land.



			 				Among the Ethiopians was the god

				 				Far off﻿—the Ethiopians most remote

				 				Of men. Two tribes there are; one dwells beneath

				 				The rising, one beneath the setting sun.

				 				He went to grace a hecatomb of beeves

				 				And lambs, and sat delighted at the feast;

				 				While in the palace of Olympian Jove

				 				The other gods assembled, and to them

				 				The father of immortals and of men

				 				Was speaking. To his mind arose the thought

				 				Of that Aegisthus whom the famous son

				 				Of Agamemnon, Prince Orestes, slew.

				 				Of him he thought and thus bespake the gods:﻿—



			 				“How strange it is that mortals blame the gods

				 				And say that we inflict the ills they bear,

				 				When they, by their own folly and against

				 				The will of fate, bring sorrow on themselves!

				 				As late Aegisthus, unconstrained by fate,

				 				Married the queen of Atreus’ son and slew

				 				The husband just returned from war. Yet well

				 				He knew the bitter penalty, for we

				 				Warned him. We sent the herald Argicide,

				 				Bidding him neither slay the chief nor woo

				 				His queen, for that Orestes, when he came

				 				To manhood and might claim his heritage,

				 				Would take due vengeance for Atrides slain.

				 				So Hermes said; his prudent words moved not

				 				The purpose of Aegisthus who now pays

				 				The forfeit of his many crimes at once.”



			 				Pallas, the blue-eyed goddess, thus replied:﻿—

				 				“O father, son of Saturn, king of kings!

				 				Well he deserved his death. So perish all

				 				Guilty of deeds like his! But I am grieved

				 				For sage Ulysses, that most wretched man,

				 				So long detained, repining, and afar

				 				From those he loves, upon a distant isle

				 				Girt by the waters of the central deep﻿—

				 				A forest isle, where dwells a deity

				 				The daughter of wise Atlas, him who knows

				 				The ocean to its utmost depths, and holds

				 				Upright the lofty columns which divide

				 				The earth from heaven. The daughter there detains

				 				The unhappy chieftain, and with flattering words

				 				Would win him to forget his Ithaca.

				 				Meanwhile, impatient to behold the smokes

				 				That rise from hearths in his own land, he pines

				 				And willingly would die. Is not thy heart,

				 				Olympics, touched by this? And did he not

				 				Pay grateful sacrifice to thee beside

				 				The Argive fleet in the broad realm of Troy?

				 				Why then, O Jove, art thou so wroth with him?”



			 				Then answered cloud-compelling Jove: “My child,

				 				What words have passed thy lips? Can I forget

				 				Godlike Ulysses, who in gifts of mind

				 				Excels all other men, and who has brought

				 				Large offerings to the gods that dwell in heaven?

				 				Yet he who holds the earth in his embrace,

				 				Neptune, pursues him with perpetual hate

				 				Because of Polypheme, the Cyclops, strong

				 				Beyond all others of his giant race,

				 				Whose eye Ulysses had put out. The nymph

				 				Thoosa brought him forth﻿—a daughter she

				 				Of Phorcys, ruling in the barren deep﻿—

				 				And in the covert of o’erhanging rocks

				 				She met with Neptune. For this cause the god

				 				Who shakes the shores, although he slay him not,

				 				Sends forth Ulysses wandering far away

				 				From his own country. Let us now consult

				 				Together and provide for his return,

				 				And Neptune will lay by his wrath, for vain

				 				It were for one like him to strive alone

				 				Against the might of all the immortal gods.”



			 				And then the blue-eyed Pallas spake again:﻿—

				 				“O father! son of Saturn, king of kings!

				 				If such the pleasure of the blessed gods

				 				That now the wise Ulysses shall return

				 				To his own land, let us at once despatch

				 				Hermes, the Argicide, our messenger,

				 				Down to Ogygia, to the bright-haired nymph,

				 				And make our steadfast purpose known to bring

				 				The sufferer Ulysses to his home,

				 				And I will haste to Ithaca, and move

				 				His son, that with a resolute heart he call

				 				The long-haired Greeks together and forbid

				 				The excesses of the suitor train, who slay

				 				His flocks and slow-paced beeves with crooked horns.

				 				To Sparta I will send him and the sands

				 				Of Pylos, to inquire for the return

				 				Of his dear father. So a glorious fame

				 				Shall gather round him in the eyes of men.”



			 				She spake, and fastened underneath her feet

				 				The fair, ambrosial golden sandals worn

				 				To bear her over ocean like the wind,

				 				And o’er the boundless land. In hand she took,

				 				Well tipped with trenchant brass, the mighty spear,

				 				Heavy and huge and strong, with which she bears

				 				Whole phalanxes of heroes to the earth,

				 				When she, the daughter of a mighty sire,

				 				Is angered. From the Olympian heights she plunged,

				 				And stood among the men of Ithaca,

				 				Just at the porch and threshold of their chief,

				 				Ulysses. In her hand she bore the spear,

				 				And seemed the stranger Mentes, he who led

				 				The Taphians. There before the gate she found

				 				The haughty suitors. Some beguiled the time

				 				With draughts, while sitting on the hides of beeves

				 				Which they had slaughtered. Heralds were with them,

				 				And busy menials: some who in the bowls

				 				Tempered the wine with water, some who cleansed

				 				The tables with light sponges, and who set

				 				The banquet forth and carved the meats for all.



			 				Telemachus the godlike was the first

				 				To see the goddess as he sat among

				 				The crowd of suitors, sad at heart, and thought

				 				Of his illustrious father, who might come

				 				And scatter those who filled his palace halls,

				 				And win new honor, and regain the rule

				 				Over his own. As thus he sat and mused

				 				Among the suitors, he beheld where stood

				 				Pallas, and forth he sprang; he could not bear

				 				To keep a stranger waiting at his door.

				 				He came, and taking her right hand received

				 				The brazen spear, and spake these winged words:﻿—



			 				“Hail, stranger! thou art truly welcome here,

				 				First come and share our feast and be refreshed,

				 				Then say what thou requirest at our hands.”



			 				He spake and led the way, and in his steps

				 				Pallas Athenè followed. Entering then

				 				The lofty halls, he set the spear upright

				 				By a tall column, in the armory

				 				With polished walls, where rested many a lance

				 				Of the large-souled Ulysses. Then he placed

				 				His guest upon a throne, o’er which he spread

				 				A covering many-hued and beautiful,

				 				And gave her feet a footstool. Near to her

				 				He drew his particolored seat, aloof

				 				From where the suitors sat; that so his guest

				 				Might not amid those haughty revellers

				 				Be wearied with the tumult and enjoy

				 				His meal the less, and that himself might ask

				 				News of his absent father. In a bowl

				 				Of silver, from a shapely ewer of gold,

				 				A maid poured water for the hands, and set

				 				A polished table near them. Then approached

				 				A venerable matron bringing bread

				 				And delicacies gathered from the board;

				 				And he who served the feast before them placed

				 				Chargers with various meats, and cups of gold;

				 				While round the board a herald moved, and poured

				 				Wine for the guests. The haughty suitors now

				 				Came in, and took their places on the thrones

				 				And couches; heralds poured upon their hands

				 				The water; maidens heaped the canisters

				 				With bread, and all put forth their hands to share

				 				The banquet on the board, while to the brim

				 				Boys filled the beakers. When the calls of thirst

				 				And hunger were appeased, the suitors thought

				 				Of other things that well become a feast﻿—

				 				Song and the dance. And then a herald brought

				 				A shapely harp, and gave it to the hands

				 				Of Phemius, who had only by constraint

				 				Sung to the suitors. On the chords he struck

				 				A prelude to his lay, while, as he played,

				 				Telemachus, that others might not hear,

				 				Leaned forward, and to blue-eyed Pallas spake:﻿—



			 				“My friend and guest, wilt thou take no offence

				 				At what I say? These revellers enjoy

				 				The harp and song, for at no cost of theirs

				 				They waste the substance of another man,

				 				Whose white bones now are mouldering in the rain

				 				Upon some mainland, or are tossed about

				 				By ocean billows. Should they see him once

				 				In Ithaca, their prayers would rather rise

				 				For swifter feet than richer stores of gold

				 				And raiment. But an evil fate is his,

				 				And he has perished. Even should we hear

				 				From any of the dwellers upon earth

				 				That he is near at hand, we could not hope.

				 				For him is no return. But now, I pray,

				 				Tell me, and frankly tell me, who thou art,

				 				And of what race of men, and where thy home,

				 				And who thy parents; how the mariners

				 				Brought thee to Ithaca, and who they claim

				 				To be, for well I deem thou couldst not come

				 				Hither on foot. All this, I pray, relate

				 				Truly, that I may know the whole. Art thou

				 				For the first time arrived, or hast thou been

				 				My father’s guest? for many a stranger once

				 				Resorted to our palace, and he knew

				 				The way to win the kind regard of men.”



			 				Pallas, the blue-eyed goddess, answered thus:﻿—

				 				“I will tell all and truly. I am named

				 				Mentes; my father was the great in war

				 				Anchialus. I rule a people skilled

				 				To wield the oar, the Taphians, and I come

				 				With ship and crew across the dark blue deep

				 				To Temesè, and to a race whose speech

				 				Is different from my own, in quest of brass,

				 				And bringing bright steel with me. I have left

				 				Moored at the field behind the town my barque,

				 				Within the bay of Reithrus, and beneath

				 				The woods of Neius. We claim to be

				 				Guests by descent, and from our fathers’ time,

				 				As thou wilt learn if thou shouldst meet and ask

				 				Laertes, the old hero. It is said

				 				He comes no more within the city walls,

				 				But in the fields dwells sadly by himself,

				 				Where an old handmaid sets upon his board

				 				His food and drink when weariness unnerves

				 				His limbs in creeping o’er the fertile soil

				 				Of his rich vineyard. I am come because

				 				I heard thy father had at last returned,

				 				And now am certain that the gods delay

				 				His journey hither; for the illustrious man

				 				Cannot have died, but is detained alone

				 				Somewhere upon the ocean, in some spot

				 				Girt by the waters. There do cruel men

				 				And savage keep him, pining to depart.

				 				Now let me speak of what the gods reveal,

				 				And what I deem will surely come to pass,

				 				Although I am no seer and have no skill

				 				In omens drawn from birds. Not long the chief

				 				Will be an exile from his own dear land,

				 				Though fettered to his place by links of steel;

				 				For he has large invention, and will plan

				 				A way for his escape. Now tell me this,

				 				And truly; tall in stature as thou art,

				 				Art thou in fact Ulysses’ son? In face

				 				And glorious eyes thou dost resemble him

				 				Exceedingly; for he and I of yore

				 				Were oftentimes companions, ere he sailed

				 				For Ilium, whither also went the best

				 				Among the Argives in their roomy ships,

				 				Nor have we seen each other since that day.”



			 				Telemachus, the prudent, spake: “O guest,

				 				True answer shalt thou have. My mother says

				 				I am his son; I know not; never man

				 				Knew his own father. Would I were the son

				 				Of one whose happier lot it was to meet

				 				Amidst his own estates the approach of age.

				 				Now the most wretched of the sons of men

				 				Is he to whom they say I owe my birth.

				 				Thus is thy question answered.” Then again

				 				Spake blue-eyed Pallas: “Of a truth, the gods

				 				Ordain not that thy race, in years to come,

				 				Should be inglorious, since Penelope

				 				Hath borne thee such as I behold thee now.

				 				But frankly answer me﻿—what feast is here,

				 				And what is this assembly? What may be

				 				The occasion? is a banquet given? is this

				 				A wedding? A collation, where the guests

				 				Furnish the meats, I think it cannot be,

				 				So riotously goes the revel on

				 				Throughout the palace. A well-judging man,

				 				If he should come among them, would be moved

				 				With anger at the shameful things they do.”



			 				Again Telemachus, the prudent, spake:﻿—

				 				“Since thou dost ask me, stranger, know that once

				 				Rich and illustrious might this house be called

				 				While yet the chief was here. But now the gods

				 				Have grown unkind and willed it otherwise,

				 				They make his fate a mystery beyond

				 				The fate of other men. I should not grieve

				 				So deeply for his loss if he had fallen

				 				With his companions on the field of Troy,

				 				Or midst his kindred when the war was o’er.

				 				Then all the Greeks had built his monument,

				 				And he had left his son a heritage

				 				Of glory. Now has he become the prey

				 				Of Harpies, perishing ingloriously,

				 				Unseen, his fate unheard of, and has left

				 				Mourning and grief, my portion. Not for him

				 				Alone I grieve; the gods have cast on me

				 				Yet other hardships. All the chiefs who rule

				 				The isles, Dulichium, Samos, and the groves

				 				That shade Zacynthus, and who bear the sway

				 				In rugged Ithaca, have come to woo

				 				My mother, and from day to day consume

				 				My substance. She rejects not utterly

				 				Their hateful suit, and yet she cannot bear

				 				To end it by a marriage. Thus they waste

				 				My heritage, and soon will seek my life.”



			 				Again in grief and anger Pallas spake:﻿—

				 				“Yea, greatly dost thou need the absent chief

				 				Ulysses here, that he might lay his hands

				 				Upon these shameless suitors. Were he now

				 				To come and stand before the palace gate

				 				With helm and buckler and two spears, as first

				 				I saw him in our house, when drinking wine

				 				And feasting, just returned from Ephyrè

				 				Where Ilus dwelt, the son of Mermerus﻿—

				 				For thither went Ulysses in a barque,

				 				To seek a deadly drug with which to taint

				 				His brazen arrows; Ilus gave it not;

				 				He feared the immortal gods; my father gave

				 				The poison, for exceedingly he loved

				 				His guest﻿—could now Ulysses, in such guise,

				 				Once meet the suitors, short would be their lives

				 				And bitter would the marriage banquet be.

				 				Yet whether he return or not to take

				 				Vengeance, in his own palace, on this crew

				 				Of wassailers, rests only with the gods.

				 				Now let me counsel thee to think betimes

				 				How thou shalt thrust them from thy palace gates.

				 				Observe me, and attend to what I say:

				 				Tomorrow thou shalt call the Achaian chiefs

				 				To an assembly; speak before them all,

				 				And be the gods thy witnesses. Command

				 				The suitors all to separate for their homes;

				 				And if thy mother’s mind be bent to wed,

				 				Let her return to where her father dwells,

				 				A mighty prince, and there they will appoint

				 				Magnificent nuptials, and an ample dower

				 				Such as should honor a beloved child.

				 				And now, if thou wilt heed me, I will give

				 				A counsel for thy good. Man thy best ship

				 				With twenty rowers, and go forth to seek

				 				News of thy absent father. Thou shalt hear

				 				Haply of him from someone of the sons

				 				Of men, or else some word of rumor sent

				 				By Jove, revealing what mankind should know.

				 				First shape thy course for Pylos, and inquire

				 				Of noble Nestor; then, at Sparta, ask

				 				Of fair-haired Menelaus, for he came

				 				Last of the mailed Achaians to his home.

				 				And shouldst thou learn that yet thy father lives,

				 				And will return, have patience yet a year,

				 				However hard it seem. But shouldst thou find

				 				That he is now no more, return forthwith

				 				To thy own native land, and pile on high

				 				His monument, and let the funeral rites

				 				Be sumptuously performed as may become

				 				The dead, and let thy mother wed again.

				 				And when all this is fully brought to pass,

				 				Take counsel with thy spirit and thy heart

				 				How to destroy the suitor crew that haunt

				 				Thy palace, whether by a secret snare

				 				Or open force. No longer shouldst thou act

				 				As if thou wert a boy; thou hast outgrown

				 				The age of childish sports. Hast thou not heard

				 				What honor the divine Orestes gained

				 				With all men, when he slew the murderer,

				 				The crafty wretch Aegisthus, by whose hand

				 				The illustrious father of Orestes died?

				 				And then, my friend﻿—for I perceive that thou

				 				Art of a manly and a stately growth﻿—

				 				Be also bold, that men hereafter born

				 				May give thee praise. And now must I depart

				 				To my good ship, and to my friends who wait,

				 				Too anxiously perhaps, for my return.

				 				Act wisely now, and bear my words in mind.”



			 				The prudent youth Telemachus rejoined:﻿—

				 				“Well hast thou spoken, and with kind intent,

				 				O stranger! like a father to a son;

				 				And ne’er shall I forget what thou hast said.

				 				Yet stay, I pray thee, though in haste, and bathe

				 				And be refreshed, and take to thy good ship

				 				Some gift with thee, such as may please thee well,

				 				Precious and rare, which thou mayst ever keep

				 				In memory of me﻿—a gift like those

				 				Which friendly hosts bestow upon their guests.”



			 				Then spake the blue-eyed Pallas: “Stay me not,

				 				For now would I depart. Whatever gift

				 				Thy heart may prompt thee to bestow, reserve

				 				Till I come back, that I may bear it home,

				 				And thou shalt take some precious thing in turn.”



			 				So spake the blue-eyed Pallas, and withdrew,

				 				Ascending like a bird. She filled his heart

				 				With strength and courage, waking vividly

				 				His father’s memory. Then the noble youth

				 				Went forth among the suitors. Silent all

				 				They sat and listened to the illustrious bard,

				 				Who sang of the calamitous return

				 				Of the Greek host from Troy, at the command

				 				Of Pallas. From her chamber o’er the hall

				 				The daughter of Icarius, the sage queen

				 				Penelope, had heard the heavenly strain,

				 				And knew its theme. Down by the lofty stairs

				 				She came, but not alone; there followed her

				 				Two maidens. When the glorious lady reached

				 				The threshold of the strong-built hall, where sat

				 				The suitors, holding up a delicate veil

				 				Before her face, and with a gush of tears,

				 				The queen bespake the sacred minstrel thus:﻿—



			 				“Phemius! thou knowest many a pleasing theme﻿—

				 				The deeds of gods and heroes, such as bards

				 				Are wont to celebrate. Take then thy place

				 				And sing of one of these, and let the guests

				 				In silence drink the wine; but cease this strain;

				 				It is too sad; it cuts me to the heart,

				 				And wakes a sorrow without bounds﻿—such grief

				 				I bear for him, my lord, of whom I think

				 				Continually; whose glory is abroad

				 				Through Hellas and through Argos, everywhere.”



			 				And then Telemachus, the prudent, spake:﻿—

				 				“Why, O my mother! canst thou not endure

				 				That thus the well-graced poet should delight

				 				His hearers with a theme to which his mind

				 				Is inly moved? The bards deserve no blame;

				 				Jove is the cause, for he at will inspires

				 				The lay that each must sing. Reprove not, then,

				 				The minstrel who relates the unhappy fate

				 				Of the Greek warriors. All men most applaud

				 				The song that has the newest theme; and thou﻿—

				 				Strengthen thy heart to hear it. Keep in mind

				 				That not alone Ulysses is cut off

				 				From his return, but that with him at Troy

				 				Have many others perished. Now withdraw

				 				Into thy chamber; ply thy household tasks,

				 				The loom, the spindle; bid thy maidens speed

				 				Their work. To say what words beseem a feast

				 				Belongs to man, and most to me; for here

				 				Within these walls the authority is mine.”



			 				The matron, wondering at his words, withdrew

				 				To her own place, but in her heart laid up

				 				Her son’s wise sayings. When she now had reached,

				 				With her attendant maids, the upper rooms,

				 				She mourned Ulysses, her beloved spouse,

				 				And wept, till blue-eyed Pallas closed her lids

				 				In gentle slumbers. Noisily, meanwhile,

				 				The suitors revelled in the shadowy halls;

				 				And thus Telemachus, the prudent, spake:﻿—



			 				“Ye suitors of my mother, insolent

				 				And overbearing; cheerful be our feast,

				 				Not riotous. It would become us well

				 				To listen to the lay of such a bard,

				 				So like the gods in voice. I bid you all

				 				Meet in full council with the morrow morn,

				 				That I may give you warning to depart

				 				From out my palace, and to seek your feasts

				 				Elsewhere at your own charge﻿—haply to hold

				 				Your daily banquets at each other’s homes.

				 				But if it seem to you the better way

				 				To plunder one man’s goods, go on to waste

				 				My substance; I will call the immortal gods

				 				To aid me, and if Jupiter allow

				 				Fit retribution for your deeds, ye die,

				 				Within this very palace, unavenged.”



			 				He spake; the suitors bit their close-pressed lips,

				 				Astonished at the youth’s courageous words.

				 				And thus Antinoüs, Eupeithes’ son,

				 				Made answer: “Most assuredly the gods,

				 				Telemachus, have taught thee how to frame

				 				Grand sentences and gallantly harangue.

				 				Ne’er may the son of Saturn make thee king

				 				Over the seagirt Ithaca, whose isle

				 				Is thy inheritance by claim of birth.”



			 				Telemachus, the prudent, thus rejoined:﻿—

				 				“Wilt thou be angry at the word I speak,

				 				Antinoüs? I would willingly accept

				 				The kingly station if conferred by Jove.

				 				Dost thou indeed regard it as the worst

				 				Of all conditions of mankind? Not so

				 				For him who reigns; his house grows opulent,

				 				And he the more is honored. Many kings

				 				Within the bounds of seagirt Ithaca

				 				There are, both young and old, let anyone

				 				Bear rule, since great Ulysses is no more;

				 				But I will be the lord of mine own house,

				 				And o’er my servants whom the godlike chief,

				 				Ulysses, brought from war, his share of spoil.”



			 				Eurymachus, the son of Polybus,

				 				Addressed the youth in turn: “Assuredly,

				 				What man hereafter, of the Achaian race,

				 				Shall bear the rule o’er seagirt Ithaca

				 				Rests with the gods. But thou shalt keep thy wealth,

				 				And may no son of violence come to make

				 				A spoil of thy possessions while men dwell

				 				In Ithaca. And now, my friend, I ask

				 				Who was thy guest; whence came he, of what land

				 				Claims he to be, where do his kindred dwell,

				 				And where his patrimonial acres lie?

				 				With tidings of thy father’s near return

				 				Came he, or to receive a debt? How swift

				 				Was his departure, waiting not for us

				 				To know him! yet in aspect and in air

				 				He seemed to be no man of vulgar note.”



			 				Telemachus, the prudent, answered thus:﻿—

				 				“My father’s coming, O Eurymachus,

				 				Is to be hoped no more; nor can I trust

				 				Tidings from whatsoever part they come,

				 				Nor pay regard to oracles, although

				 				My mother send to bring a soothsayer

				 				Within the palace, and inquire of him.

				 				But this man was my father’s guest; he comes

				 				From Taphos; Mentes is his name, a son

				 				Of the brave chief Anchialus; he reigns

				 				Over the Taphians, men who love the sea.”



			 				He spake, but in his secret heart he knew

				 				The immortal goddess. Then the suitors turned.

				 				Delighted, to the dance and cheerful song,

				 				And waited for the evening. On their sports

				 				The evening with its shadowy blackness came;

				 				Then each to his own home withdrew to sleep,

				 				While to his lofty chamber, in full view,

				 				Built high in that magnificent palace home,

				 				Telemachus went up, and sought his couch,

				 				Intent on many thoughts. The chaste and sage

				 				Dame Eurycleia by his side went up

				 				With lighted torches﻿—she a child of Ops,

				 				Pisenor’s son. Her, in her early bloom,

				 				Laertes purchased for a hundred beeves,

				 				And in his palace honored equally

				 				With his chaste wife; yet never sought her bed.

				 				He would not wrong his queen. ’Twas she who bore

				 				The torches with Telemachus. She loved

				 				Her young lord more than all the other maids,

				 				And she had nursed him in his tender years.

				 				He opened now the chamber door and sat

				 				Upon the couch, put his soft tunic off

				 				And placed it in the prudent matron’s hands.

				 				She folded it and smoothed it, hung it near

				 				To that fair bed, and, going quickly forth,

				 				Pulled at the silver ring to close the door,

				 				And drew the thong that moved the fastening bolt.

				 				He, lapped in the soft fleeces, all night long.

				 				Thought of the voyage Pallas had ordained.





						Book 						II


					Departure of Telemachus from Ithaca


				 				The chief men of Ithaca assembled by Telemachus﻿—His complaint of the suitors﻿—Their attempt to justify themselves﻿—Prophecy of the return of Ulysses by the seer, Halitherses﻿—Request of Telemachus for a vessel to visit Pylos and Sparta, in quest of his father, granted by the assembly﻿—Preparations for his departure.





				Now when the Morning, child of Dawn, appeared,

				 				The dear son of Ulysses left his bed

				 				And put his garments on. His trenchant sword

				 				He hung upon his shoulders, and made fast

				 				His shapely sandals to his shining feet,

				 				And issued from his chamber like a god.

				 				At once he bade the clear-voiced heralds call

				 				The long-haired Greeks to council. They obeyed,

				 				Quickly the chiefs assembled, and when all

				 				Were at the appointed place, Telemachus

				 				Went to the council, bearing in his hand

				 				A brazen spear, yet went he not alone.

				 				Two swift dogs followed him, while Pallas shed

				 				A heavenly beauty over him, and all

				 				Admired him as he came. He took the seat

				 				Of his great father, and the aged men

				 				Made way for him. And then Aegyptius spake﻿—

				 				A hero bowed with age, who much had seen

				 				And known. His son, the warlike Antiphus,

				 				Went with the great Ulysses in his fleet

				 				To courser-breeding Troy, and afterward

				 				The cruel Cyclops, in the vaulted cave,

				 				Slew him for his last meal. Three other sons

				 				There were, and one of these, Eurynomus,

				 				Was of the suitor train; the others took

				 				Charge of their father’s acres. Never yet

				 				Had he forgotten his lost son or ceased

				 				To grieve for him, and as he spoke he wept



			 				“Hear, men of Ithaca, what I shall say.

				 				No council, no assembly, have we held

				 				Since great Ulysses in his roomy ships

				 				Departed from our isle. Who now is he

				 				That summons us? On which of our young men

				 				Or elders presses this necessity?

				 				Is it belike that one of you has heard

				 				Of an approaching foe, and can declare

				 				The tidings clearly? Or would he propose

				 				And urge some other matter which concerns

				 				The public weal? A just and generous mind

				 				I deem is his, and ’tis my hope that Jove

				 				Will bring to pass the good at which he aims.”



			 				As thus he spake Ulysses’ son rejoiced

				 				In his auspicious words, nor longer kept

				 				His seat, but, yielding to an inward force,

				 				Rose midst them all to speak, while in his hand

				 				Pisenor, the sagacious counsellor

				 				And herald, placed the sceptre. Then he turned

				 				To the old man, Aegyptius, speaking thus:﻿—



			 				“O aged man, not far from thee is he

				 				Who called this council, as thou soon shalt know

				 				Mine chiefly is the trouble; I have brought

				 				No news of an approaching foe, which I

				 				Was first to hear, and would declare to all,

				 				Nor urge I other matters which concern

				 				The public weal; my own necessity﻿—

				 				The evil that has fallen on my house﻿—

				 				Constrains me; it is twofold. First, that I

				 				Have lost an excellent father, who was king

				 				Among you, and ruled o’er you with a sway

				 				As gentle as a father’s. Greater yet

				 				Is the next evil, and will soon o’erthrow

				 				My house and waste my substance utterly.

				 				Suitors, the sons of those who, in our isle,

				 				Hold the chief rank, importunately press

				 				Round my unwilling mother. They disdain

				 				To ask her of Icarius, that the king

				 				Her father may endow her, and bestow

				 				His daughter on the man who best may gain

				 				His favor, but with every day they come

				 				Into our palace, sacrificing here

				 				Oxen and sheep and fatling goats, and hold

				 				High festival, and drink the purple wine

				 				Unstinted, with unbounded waste; for here

				 				Is no man like Ulysses to repel

				 				The mischief from my house. Not such are we

				 				As he was, to resist the wrong. We pass

				 				For weaklings, immature in valor, yet

				 				If I had but the power, assuredly

				 				I would resist, for by these men are done

				 				Insufferable things, nor does my house

				 				Perish with honor. Ye yourselves should feel

				 				Shame at these doings; ye should dread reproach

				 				From those who dwell around us, and should fear

				 				The offended gods, lest they repay these crimes

				 				With vengeance. I beseech you, O my friends,

				 				Both by Olympian Jove, and her by whom

				 				Councils of men are summoned and dissolved﻿—

				 				The goddess Themis﻿—that ye all refrain,

				 				And leave me to my grief alone, unless

				 				Ulysses, my great father, may have done

				 				Wrong in his anger to the gallant Greeks,

				 				Which ye, by prompting men to acts like these,

				 				Seek to avenge on me. Far better ’twere,

				 				Should ye yourselves destroy our goods and slay

				 				Our herds, since, were it so, there might in time

				 				Be some requital. We, from street to street,

				 				Would plead continually for recompense,

				 				Till all should be restored. But now ye heap

				 				Upon me wrongs for which is no redress.”



			 				Thus angrily he spake, and clashed to earth

				 				The sceptre, shedding tears. The people felt

				 				Compassion; all were silent for a space,

				 				And there was none who dared with railing words

				 				Answer Telemachus, save one alone,

				 				Antinoüs, who arose and thus replied:﻿—



			 				“Telemachus, thou youth of braggart speech

				 				And boundless in abuse, what hast thou said

				 				To our dishonor? Thou wouldst fix on us

				 				A brand of shame. The blame is not with us,

				 				The Achaian suitors; ’tis thy mother’s fault,

				 				Skilled as she is in crafty shifts. ’Tis now

				 				Already the third year, and soon will be

				 				The fourth, since she began to cozen us.

				 				She gives us all to hope, and sends fair words

				 				To each by message, yet in her own mind

				 				Has other purposes. This shrewd device

				 				She planned; she laid upon the loom a web,

				 				Delicate, wide, and vast in length, and said

				 				Thus to us all: ‘Young princes, who are come

				 				To woo me, since Ulysses is no more﻿—

				 				My noble husband﻿—urge me not, I pray,

				 				To marriage, till I finish in the loom﻿—

				 				That so my threads may not be spun in vain﻿—

				 				A funeral vesture for the hero-chief

				 				Laertes, when his fatal hour shall come

				 				With death’s long sleep. Else some Achaian dame

				 				Might blame me, should I leave without a shroud

				 				Him who in life possessed such ample wealth!’

				 				Such were her words, and easily they wrought

				 				Upon our generous minds. So went she on,

				 				Weaving that ample web, and every night

				 				Unravelled it by torchlight. Three full years

				 				She practised thus, and by the fraud deceived

				 				The Grecian youths; but when the hours had brought

				 				The fourth year round, a woman who knew all

				 				Revealed the mystery, and we ourselves

				 				Saw her unravelling the ample web.

				 				Thenceforth, constrained, and with unwilling hands,

				 				She finished it. Now let the suitors make

				 				Their answer to thy words, that thou mayst know

				 				Our purpose fully, and the Achaians all

				 				May know it likewise. Send thy mother hence,

				 				Requiring that she wed the suitor whom

				 				Her father chooses and herself prefers.

				 				But if she still go on to treat the sons

				 				Of Greece with such despite, too confident

				 				In gifts which Pallas has bestowed on her

				 				So richly, noble arts, and faculties

				 				Of mind, and crafty shifts, beyond all those

				 				Of whom we ever heard that lived of yore,

				 				The bright-haired ladies of the Achaian race,

				 				Tyro, Alcmena, and Mycenè, famed

				 				For glossy tresses, none of them endowed

				 				As is Penelope, though this last shift

				 				Be ill devised﻿—so long will we consume

				 				Thy substance and estate as she shall hold

				 				Her present mood, the purpose which the gods

				 				Have planted in her breast. She to herself

				 				Gains great renown, but surely brings on thee

				 				Loss of much goods. And now we go not hence

				 				To our affairs nor elsewhere, till she wed

				 				Whichever of the Greeks may please her most.”



			 				And then rejoined discreet Telemachus:﻿—

				 				“Antinoüs, grievous wrong it were to send

				 				Unwilling from this palace her who bore

				 				And nursed me. Whether he be living yet

				 				Or dead, my father is in distant lands;

				 				And should I, of my own accord and will,

				 				Dismiss my mother, I must make perforce

				 				Icarius large amends, and that were hard.

				 				And he would do me mischief, and the gods

				 				Would send yet other evils on my head.

				 				For then my mother, going forth, would call

				 				On the grim Furies, and the general curse

				 				Of all men would be on me. Think not I

				 				Will ever speak that word. But if ye bear

				 				A sense of injury for what is past,

				 				Go from these halls; provide for other feasts,

				 				Consuming what is yours, and visiting

				 				Each other’s homes in turn. But if it seem

				 				To you the wiser and the better way

				 				To plunder one man’s goods, go on to waste

				 				My substance. I shall call the eternal gods

				 				To aid me, and, if Jupiter allow

				 				Fit retribution for your crimes, ye die

				 				Within this very palace unavenged.”



			 				So spake Telemachus. The Thunderer, Jove,

				 				Sent flying from a lofty mountain-top

				 				Two eagles. First they floated on the wind

				 				Close to each other, and with wings outspread;

				 				But as they came to where the murmuring crowd

				 				Was gathered just beneath their flight, they turned

				 				And clapped their heavy pinions, looking down

				 				With deadly omen on the heads below,

				 				And with their talons tore each other’s cheeks

				 				And necks, and then they darted to the right

				 				Away through Ithaca among its roofs.

				 				All who beheld the eagles were amazed,

				 				And wondered what event was near at hand.

				 				Among the rest an aged hero spake,

				 				Named Halitherses, Mastor’s son. He knew

				 				More truly than the others of his age,

				 				To augur from the flight of birds, and read

				 				The will of fate﻿—and wisely thus he spake:﻿—



			 				“Hear, men of Ithaca, what I shall say.

				 				I speak of what most narrowly concerns

				 				The suitors, over whom already hangs

				 				Great peril, for Ulysses will not be

				 				Long at a distance from his home and friends.

				 				Even now he is not far, and meditates

				 				Slaughter and death to all the suitor train;

				 				And evil will ensue to many more

				 				Of us, who dwell in sunny Ithaca.

				 				Now let us think what measures may restrain

				 				These men﻿—or let them of their own accord

				 				Desist﻿—the soonest were for them the best.

				 				For not as one untaught do I foretell

				 				Events to come, but speak of what I know.

				 				All things that I predicted to our chief,

				 				What time the Argive troops embarked for Troy,

				 				And sage Ulysses with them, are fulfilled;

				 				I said that after many hardships borne,

				 				And all his comrades lost, the twentieth year

				 				Would bring him back, a stranger to us all﻿—

				 				And all that then I spake of comes to pass.”



			 				Eurymachus, the son of Polybus,

				 				Answered the seer: “Go to thy house, old man,

				 				And to thy boys, and prophesy to them,

				 				Lest evil come upon them. I can act,

				 				In matters such as these, a prophet’s part

				 				Better than thou. True, there are many birds

				 				That fly about in sunshine, but not all

				 				Are ominous. Ulysses far away

				 				Has perished; well it would have been if thou

				 				Hadst perished with him; then thou wouldst not prate

				 				Idly of things to come, nor wouldst thou stir

				 				Telemachus to anger, in the hope

				 				Of bearing to thy house some gift from him.

				 				Now let me say, and be assured my words

				 				Will be fulfilled: experienced as thou art,

				 				If thou by treacherous speeches shalt inflame

				 				A younger man than thou to violent deeds,

				 				The sharper punishment shall first be his,

				 				But we will lay on thee a penalty,

				 				Old man, which thou shalt find it hard to bear,

				 				And bitterly wilt thou repent. And now

				 				Let me persuade Telemachus to send

				 				His mother to her father. They will make

				 				A marriage for her there, and give with her

				 				A liberal dowry, such as may become

				 				A favorite daughter on her wedding-day,

				 				Else never will the sons of Greece renounce,

				 				I think, the difficult suit. We do not fear

				 				Telemachus himself, though glib of speech,

				 				Nor care we for the empty oracle

				 				Which thou, old man, dost utter, making thee

				 				Only more hated. Still will his estate

				 				Be wasted, nor will order e’er return

				 				While she defers her marriage with some prince

				 				Of the Achaians. We shall urge our suit

				 				For that most excellent of womankind

				 				As rivals, nor withdraw to seek the hand

				 				Of others, whom we fitly might espouse.”



			 				To this discreet Telemachus replied:﻿—

				 				“Eurymachus, and ye, the illustrious train

				 				Of suitors, I have nothing more to ask﻿—

				 				No more to say﻿—for now the gods and all

				 				The Achaians know the truth. But let me have

				 				A gallant barque, and twenty men to make

				 				From coast to coast a voyage, visiting

				 				Sparta and sandy Pylos, to inquire

				 				For my long-absent father, and the chance

				 				Of his return, if any of mankind

				 				Can tell me aught, or if some rumor come

				 				From Jove, since thus are tidings often brought

				 				To human knowledge. Should I learn that yet

				 				He lives and may return, I then would wait

				 				A twelvemonth, though impatient. Should I hear

				 				That he no longer lives, I shall return

				 				Homeward, and pile his monument on high

				 				With funeral honors that become the dead,

				 				And give my mother to a second spouse.”



			 				He spake and took his seat, and then arose

				 				Mentor, once comrade of the excellent chief

				 				Ulysses, who, departing with his fleet,

				 				Consigned his household to the aged man,

				 				That they should all obey him, and that he

				 				Should safely keep his charge. He rose amid

				 				The assembly, and addressed them wisely thus:﻿—



			 				“Hear and attend, ye men of Ithaca,

				 				To what I say. Let never sceptred king

				 				Henceforth be gracious, mild, and merciful,

				 				And righteous; rather be he deaf to prayer

				 				And prone to deeds of wrong, since no one now

				 				Remembers the divine Ulysses more,

				 				Among the people over whom he ruled

				 				Benignly like a father. Yet I bear

				 				No envy to the haughty suitors here,

				 				Moved as they are to deeds of violence

				 				By evil counsels, since, in pillaging

				 				The substance of Ulysses, who they say

				 				Will nevermore return, they risk their lives.

				 				But I am angry with the rest, with all

				 				Of you who sit here mute, nor even with words

				 				Of stern reproof restrain their violence,

				 				Though ye so many are and they so few.”



			 				Leiocritus, Evenor’s son, rejoined:﻿—

				 				“Malicious Mentor, foolish man! what talk

				 				Is this of holding us in check? ’Twere hard

				 				For numbers even greater than our own

				 				To drive us from a feast. And should the prince

				 				Of Ithaca, Ulysses, come himself,

				 				Thinking to thrust the illustrious suitors forth

				 				That banquet in these palace halls, his queen

				 				Would have no cause for joy at his return,

				 				Greatly as she desired it. He would draw

				 				Sure death upon himself in strife with us

				 				Who are so many. Thou hast spoken ill.

				 				Now let the people who are gathered here

				 				Disperse to their employments. We will leave

				 				Mentor and Halitherses, who were both

				 				His father’s early comrades, to provide

				 				For the youth’s voyage. He will yet remain

				 				A long time here, I think, to ask for news

				 				In Ithaca, and never will set sail.”



			 				Thus having said, he instantly dismissed

				 				The people; they departed to their homes;

				 				The suitors sought the palace of the prince.



			 				Then to the ocean-side, apart from all,

				 				Went forth Telemachus, and washed his hands

				 				In the gray surf, and prayed to Pallas thus:﻿—



			 				“Hear me, thou deity who yesterday,

				 				In visiting our palace, didst command

				 				That I should traverse the black deep to learn

				 				News of my absent father, and the chance

				 				Of his return! The Greeks themselves withstand,

				 				My purpose; the proud suitors most of all.”



			 				Such was his prayer, and straightway Pallas stood,

				 				In form and voice like Mentor, by his side,

				 				And thus accosted him with winged words:﻿—



			 				“Telemachus, thou henceforth shalt not lack

				 				Valor or wisdom. If with thee abides

				 				Thy father’s gallant spirit, as he was

				 				In deed and word, thou wilt not vainly make

				 				This voyage. But if thou be not in truth

				 				The son of him and of Penelope,

				 				Then I rely not on thee to perform

				 				What thou dost meditate. Few sons are like

				 				Their fathers: most are worse, a very few

				 				Excel their parents. Since thou wilt not lack

				 				Valor and wisdom in the coming time,

				 				Nor is thy father’s shrewdness wanting quite

				 				In thee, great hope there is that happily

				 				This plan will be fulfilled. Regard not then

				 				The suitor train, their purposes and plots.

				 				Senseless are they, as little wise as just,

				 				And have no thought of the black doom of death

				 				Now drawing near to sweep them in a day

				 				To their destruction. But thy enterprise

				 				Must suffer no delay. So much am I

				 				Thy father’s friend and thine, that I will cause

				 				A swift barque to be fitted out for sea,

				 				And will myself attend thee. Go now hence

				 				Among the suitors, and make ready there

				 				The needful stores, and let them all be put

				 				In vessels﻿—wine in jars, and meal, the strength

				 				Of man, in close thick skins﻿—while I engage,

				 				Among the people here, a willing crew.

				 				Ships are there in our seagirt Ithaca

				 				Full many, new and old, and I will choose

				 				The best of these, and see it well equipped.

				 				Then will we drag it down to the broad sea.”



			 				Thus Pallas spake, the child of Jupiter.

				 				Telemachus obeyed the heavenly voice,

				 				And stayed not; home he hastened, where he saw

				 				Sadly the arrogant suitors in the hall,

				 				Busily flaying goats and roasting swine.

				 				Antinoüs, laughing, came to meet the youth.

				 				And fastened on his hand, and thus he spake:﻿—



			 				“Telemachus, thou youth of lofty speech

				 				And boundless in abuse, let neither word

				 				Nor deed that may displease thee vex thy heart,

				 				But gayly eat and drink as thou wert wont.

				 				The Achaians generously will provide

				 				Whatever thou requirest, ship and men﻿—

				 				All chosen rowers﻿—that thou mayst arrive

				 				Sooner at sacred Pylos, there to learn

				 				Tidings of thy illustrious father’s fate.”



			 				Then spake discreet Telemachus in turn:﻿—

				 				“Antinoüs, never could I sit with you,

				 				Arrogant ones! in silence nor enjoy

				 				The feast in quiet. Is it not enough,

				 				O suitors, that while I was yet a child

				 				Ye wasted on your revelries my large

				 				And rich possessions? Now that I am grown,

				 				And, when I hear the words of other men,

				 				Discern their meaning, now that every day

				 				Strengthens my spirit, I will make the attempt

				 				To bring the evil fates upon your heads,

				 				Whether I go to Pylos or remain

				 				Among this people. I shall surely make

				 				This voyage, and it will not be in vain.

				 				Although I go a passenger on board

				 				Another’s ship﻿—since neither ship have I

				 				Nor rowers﻿—ye have judged that so were best.”



			 				He spake, and quickly from the suitor’s hand

				 				Withdrew his own. The others who prepared

				 				Their banquet in the palace scoffed at him,

				 				And flung at him their bitter taunts, and one

				 				Among the insolent youths reviled him thus:﻿—



			 				“Telemachus is certainly resolved

				 				To butcher us. He goes to bring allies

				 				From sandy Pylos or the Spartan coast,

				 				He is so bent on slaughter. Or perhaps

				 				He visits the rich land of Ephyrè

				 				In search of deadly poisons to be thrown

				 				Into a cup and end us all at once.”



			 				Then said another of the haughty youths:﻿—

				 				“Who knows but, wandering in his hollow barque,

				 				He too may perish, far from all his friends,

				 				Just as Ulysses perished? This would bring

				 				Increase of labor; it would cast on us

				 				The trouble to divide his goods, and give

				 				His palace to his mother, and to him

				 				Who takes the woman as his wedded wife.”



			 				So spake they, but Telemachus went down

				 				To that high-vaulted room, his father’s, where

				 				Lay heaps of gold and brass, and garments store

				 				In chests, and fragrant oils. And there stood casks

				 				Of delicate old wine and pure, a drink

				 				For gods, in rows against the wall, to wait

				 				If ever, after many hardships borne,

				 				Ulysses should return. Upon that room

				 				Close-fitting double doors were shut, and there

				 				Was one who night and day kept diligent watch,

				 				A woman, Eurycleia, child of Ops,

				 				Peisenor’s son. Telemachus went in

				 				And called her to him, and bespake her thus:﻿—



			 				“Nurse, let sweet wine be drawn into my jars,

				 				The finest next to that which thou dost keep

				 				Expecting our unhappy lord, if yet

				 				The nobly born Ulysses shall escape

				 				The doom of death and come to us again.

				 				Fill twelve, and fit the covers close, and pour

				 				Meal into well-sewn skins, and let the tale

				 				Be twenty measures of the flour of wheat.

				 				This none but thou must know. Let all these things

				 				Be brought together; then, as night shuts in,

				 				When to her upper chamber, seeking rest,

				 				My mother shall withdraw, I come and take

				 				What thou providest for me. I am bound

				 				For Sparta and for Pylos in the sands,

				 				To gather news concerning the return

				 				Of my dear father, if I haply may.”



			 				So spake the youth, and his beloved nurse

				 				Sobbed, wept aloud, and spake these winged words:﻿—



			 				“Why should there come, dear child, a thought like this

				 				Into thy heart. Why wouldst thou wander forth

				 				To distant regions﻿—thou an only son

				 				And dearly loved? Ulysses, nobly born,

				 				Has perished, from his native land afar,

				 				’Mid a strange race. These men, when thou art gone,

				 				At once will lay their plots to take thy life,

				 				And share thy wealth among them. Stay thou here

				 				Among thy people; need is none that thou

				 				Shouldst suffer, roaming o’er the barren deep.”



			 				Then spake discreet Telemachus again:﻿—

				 				“Be of good cheer, O nurse, for my design

				 				Is not without the sanction of a god;

				 				But swear thou not to let my mother know

				 				Of my intent until the eleventh day

				 				Or twelfth shall pass, or till, in missing me,

				 				She learn of my departure, lest she weep

				 				And stain with tears the beauty of her face.”



			 				He spake; the ancient woman solemnly

				 				Swore by the gods, and when the rite was o’er

				 				Drew wine into the jars, and poured the meal

				 				Into the well-sewn skins. Telemachus

				 				Entered the hall and joined the suitor train.



			 				Then did the blue-eyed goddess turn her thoughts

				 				To other plans, and taking on herself

				 				The semblance of Telemachus, she ranged

				 				The city, speaking to each man in turn,

				 				And bidding him at nightfall to repair

				 				To where the good ship lay. That gallant ship

				 				She begged of the renowned Noëmon, son

				 				Of Phronius, who with cheerful grace complied.



			 				The sun went down, the city streets lay all

				 				In shadow. Then she drew the good ship down

				 				Into the sea, and brought and put on board

				 				The appointments every well-built galley needs,

				 				And moored her at the bottom of the port,

				 				Where, in a throng, obedient to the word

				 				Of Pallas, round her came her gallant crew.



			 				With yet a new device the blue-eyed maid

				 				Went to the palace of the godlike chief

				 				Ulysses, where she poured a gentle sleep

				 				Over the suitors. As they drank she made

				 				Their senses wander, and their hands let fall

				 				The goblets. Now no longer at the board

				 				They sat, but sallied forth, and through the town

				 				Went to their slumbers, for the power of sleep

				 				Had fallen heavily upon their lids.

				 				Then blue-eyed Pallas from those sumptuous halls

				 				Summoned Telemachus. She took the form

				 				And voice of Mentor, and bespake him thus:﻿—



			 				“Telemachus, already at their oars

				 				Sit thy well-armed companions and await

				 				Thy coming; let us go without delay.”



			 				Thus having spoken, Pallas led the way

				 				With rapid footsteps which he followed fast;

				 				Till having reached the galley and the sea

				 				They found their long-haired comrades at the beach,

				 				And thus the gallant prince Telemachus

				 				Bespake them: “Hither, comrades, let us bring

				 				The sea-stores from the dwelling where they lie;

				 				My mother knows not of it, nor her maids;

				 				The secret has been told to one alone.”



			 				He spake, and went before them. In his steps

				 				They followed. To the gallant barque they brought

				 				The stores, and, as the well-beloved son

				 				Of King Ulysses bade, they laid them down

				 				Within the hull. Telemachus went up

				 				The vessel’s side, but Pallas first embarked,

				 				And at the stern sat down, while next to her

				 				Telemachus was seated. Then the crew

				 				Cast loose the fastenings and went all on board,

				 				And took their places on the rowers’ seats,

				 				While blue-eyed Pallas sent a favoring breeze,

				 				A fresh wind from the west, that murmuring swept

				 				The dark-blue main. Telemachus gave forth

				 				The word to wield the tackle; they obeyed,

				 				And raised the fir-tree mast, and, fitting it

				 				Into its socket, bound it fast with cords,

				 				And drew and spread with firmly twisted ropes

				 				The shining sails on high. The steady wind

				 				Swelled out the canvas in the midst; the ship

				 				Moved on, the dark sea roaring round her keel,

				 				As swiftly through the waves she cleft her way.

				 				And when the rigging of that swift black ship

				 				Was firmly in its place, they filled their cups

				 				With wine, and to the ever-living gods

				 				Poured out libations, most of all to one,

				 				Jove’s blue-eyed daughter. Thus through all that night

				 				And all the ensuing morn they held their way.





						Book 						III


					Interview of Telemachus with Nestor


				 				Arrival of Telemachus, with Pallas in the shape of Mentor, at Pylos﻿—His interview with Nestor﻿—Nestor’s narrative of his return from Troy﻿—History of the death of Agamemnon and the revenge of Orestes﻿—Departure of Pallas to heaven﻿—Telemachus sent by Nestor with his son Peisistratus to Menelaus at Sparta.





				Now from the fair broad bosom of the sea

				 				Into the brazen vault of heaven the sun

				 				Rose shining for the immortals and for men

				 				Upon the foodful earth. The voyagers

				 				Arrived at Pylos, nobly built, the town

				 				Of Neleus. There, upon the ocean-side,

				 				They found the people offering coal-black steers

				 				To dark-haired Neptune. On nine seats they sat,

				 				Five hundred on each seat; nine steers were slain

				 				For each five hundred there. While they performed

				 				The rite, and, tasting first the entrails, burned

				 				The thighs to ocean’s god, the Ithacans

				 				Touched land, and, lifting up the good ship’s sail,

				 				Furled it and moored the keel, and then stepped out

				 				Upon the shore. Forth from the galley came

				 				Telemachus, the goddess guiding him,

				 				And thus to him the blue-eyed Pallas said:﻿—



			 				“Telemachus, there now is no excuse,

				 				Not even the least, for shamefaced backwardness.

				 				Thou hast come hither o’er the deep to ask

				 				For tidings of thy father﻿—what far land

				 				Conceals him, what the fate that he has met.

				 				Go then at once to Nestor, the renowned

				 				In horsemanship, and we shall see what plan

				 				He hath in mind for thee. Entreat him there

				 				That frankly he declare it. He will speak

				 				No word of falsehood; he is truly wise.”



			 				And thus discreet Telemachus replied:﻿—

				 				“O Mentor, how shall I approach the chief,

				 				And with what salutation? Little skill

				 				Have I in courtly phrase, and shame becomes

				 				A youth in questioning an aged man.”



			 				Pallas, the blue-eyed goddess, spake again:﻿—

				 				“In part thy mind will prompt thy speech; in part

				 				A god will put the words into thy mouth﻿—

				 				For well I deem that thou wert neither born

				 				Nor trained without the favor of the gods.”



			 				Thus having said, the blue-eyed Pallas moved

				 				With hasty pace before, and in her steps

				 				He followed close, until they reached the seats

				 				Of those assembled Pylians. Nestor there

				 				Sat with his sons, while his companions stood

				 				Around him and prepared the feast, and some

				 				Roasted the flesh at fires, and some transfixed

				 				The parts with spits. As they beheld the approach

				 				Of strangers they advanced, and took their hands,

				 				And bade them sit. Peisistratus, a son

				 				Of Nestor, came the first of all, and took

				 				A hand of each, and placed them at the feast

				 				On the soft hides that o’er the ocean sand

				 				Were spread beside his brother Thrasymedes

				 				And his own father; brought for their repast

				 				Parts of the entrails, poured for them the wine

				 				Into a golden goblet, held it forth

				 				In his right hand, and with these words bespake

				 				Pallas, the child of aegis-bearing Jove:﻿—



			 				“Pray, stranger, to King Neptune. Ye have chanced

				 				Upon his feast in coming to our coast.

				 				And after thy libation poured, and prayer

				 				Made to the god, give over to thy friend

				 				The goblet of choice wine that he may make

				 				Libation also; he, I question not,

				 				Prays to the gods; we all have need of them.

				 				A younger man is he than thou, and seems

				 				In age to be my equal; therefore I

				 				Will give the golden goblet first to thee.”



			 				He spake, and in the hands of Pallas placed

				 				The goblet of choice wine. Well pleased was she

				 				With one so just and so discreet﻿—well pleased

				 				That first to her he reached the cup of gold,

				 				And thus she prayed to Neptune fervently:﻿—



			 				“Hear, Neptune, thou who dost embrace the earth,

				 				And of thy grace disdain not to bestow

				 				These blessings on thy suppliants. First of all

				 				Vouchsafe to Nestor and his sons increase

				 				Of glory; on the Pylian people next

				 				Bestow, for this most sumptuous hecatomb,

				 				Large recompense; and, lastly, grant to us﻿—

				 				Telemachus and me﻿—a safe return

				 				To our own country with the end attained

				 				Which brought us hither in our gallant barque.”



			 				Thus did she pray, while she fulfilled the prayer;

				 				And then she handed to Telemachus

				 				The fair round goblet, and in words like hers

				 				The dear son of Ulysses prayed. Meanwhile

				 				The Pylians, having roasted well the flesh

				 				And drawn it from the spits, distributing

				 				To each his portion, held high festival.

				 				And when the calls of hunger and of thirst

				 				Were silenced, Nestor, the Gerenian knight,

				 				Began discourse, and thus bespake his guests:﻿—



			 				“The fitting time is come to ask our guests

				 				Who they may be, since now their feast is o’er.

				 				Say then, O strangers, who ye are, and whence

				 				Ye come along the pathway of the deep.

				 				Have ye an errand here, or do ye roam

				 				The seas at large, like pirates, braving death,

				 				And visiting with ravage foreign states?”



			 				And then discreet Telemachus replied

				 				Boldly﻿—for Pallas strengthened in that hour

				 				His heart that he might confidently ask

				 				News of his absent father, and so win

				 				A worthy fame among the sons of men:﻿—



			 				“O Nestor, son of Neleus, pride of Greece!

				 				Thou bid’st us tell thee whence we came, and I

				 				Will faithfully declare it. We are come

				 				From Ithaca, beneath the Neritus,

				 				And private, and not general, is the cause

				 				Of which I am to speak. I came to ask

				 				Concerning my great father, the large-souled

				 				And nobly-born Ulysses, who ’tis said

				 				With thee, his friend in arms, laid waste the town

				 				Of Ilium. We have heard where all the rest

				 				Who warred against the Trojans were cut off,

				 				And died sad deaths; his fate alone the son

				 				Of Saturn hath not chosen to reveal﻿—

				 				Whether he fell on land by hostile hands,

				 				Or while at sea was whelmed beneath the waves

				 				Of Amphitritè. Wherefore to thy knees

				 				I come, to ask that thou﻿—if so thou wilt﻿—

				 				Relate the manner of his mournful death,

				 				As thou didst see it with thine eyes, or else

				 				As thou from other wanderers hast heard

				 				Its history; for she who brought him forth

				 				Bore him to be unhappy. Think thou not

				 				To soften aught, through tenderness to me,

				 				In thy recital, but in faithful words

				 				Tell me the whole, whatever thou hast seen.

				 				And I conjure thee, that if, in his life,

				 				My father, great Ulysses, ever gave

				 				Promise of word or deed for thee, and kept

				 				His promise, in the realm of Troy, where ye

				 				Achaians bore such hardships, that thou now

				 				Remember it and speak without disguise.”



			 				And Nestor the Gerenian knight replied:﻿—

				 				“My friend, since thou recallest to my mind

				 				The sufferings borne by us the sons of Greece,

				 				Although of peerless valor, in that land,

				 				Both when we ranged in ships the darkling sea

				 				For booty wheresoe’er Achilles led,

				 				And when around King Priam’s populous town

				 				We fought, where fell our bravest, know thou then

				 				That there the valiant Ajax lies, and there

				 				Achilles; there Patroclus, like the gods

				 				In council; there my well-beloved son

				 				Blameless and brave, Antilochus the swift

				 				Of foot and warlike﻿—many woes beside

				 				We bore, and who of mortal birth could give

				 				Their history? Nay, though thou shouldst remain

				 				Five years or six, and ask of all the griefs

				 				Endured by the brave Greeks, thou wouldst depart

				 				Outwearied to thy home, ere thou hadst heard

				 				The whole. Nine years in harassing the foe

				 				We passed, beleaguering them and planning wiles

				 				Innumerable. Saturn’s son at last

				 				With difficulty seemed to close the war.

				 				Then was there none who might presume to vie

				 				In wisdom with Ulysses; that great man

				 				Excelled in every kind of stratagem﻿—

				 				Thy father﻿—if indeed thou be his son.

				 				I look on thee amazed; all thy discourse

				 				Is just like his, and one would ne’er believe

				 				A younger man could speak so much like him.

				 				While we were there, Ulysses and myself

				 				In council or assembly never spake

				 				On different sides, but with a like intent

				 				We thoughtfully consulted how to guide

				 				The Achaians in the way we deemed the best;

				 				But after we had overthrown and spoiled

				 				King Priam’s lofty city, and set sail

				 				For home, and by some heavenly power the Greeks

				 				Were scattered, Jupiter ordained for them

				 				A sad return. For all were neither wise

				 				Nor just, and many drew upon themselves

				 				An evil doom﻿—the fatal wrath of her,

				 				The blue-eyed maid, who claims her birth from Jove.

				 				’Twas she who kindled strife between the sons

				 				Of Atreus. They had called the Achaians all

				 				To an assembly, not with due regard

				 				To order, at the setting of the sun,

				 				And thither came the warriors overpowered

				 				With wine. The brother kings set forth the cause

				 				Of that assembly. Menelaus first

				 				Bade all the Greeks prepare for their return

				 				O’er the great deep. That counsel little pleased

				 				King Agamemnon, who desired to keep

				 				The people longer there, that he might soothe

				 				By sacred hecatombs the fiery wrath

				 				Of Pallas. Fool! who could not see how vain

				 				Were such persuasion, for the eternal gods

				 				Are not soon won to change their purposes.

				 				They stood disputing thus, with bitter words,

				 				Till wrangling noisily on different sides

				 				Rose up the well-armed Greeks. The ensuing night

				 				We rested, but we cherished in our breasts

				 				A mutual hate; so for our punishment

				 				Had Jove ordained. With early morn we drew

				 				Our ships to the great deep, and put our goods

				 				And our deep-bosomed women all on board.

				 				Yet half the host went not, but on the shore

				 				Remained with Agamemnon, Atreus’ son,

				 				And shepherd of the people. All the rest

				 				Embarked, weighed anchor, and sailed swiftly thence;

				 				A deity made smooth the mighty deep,

				 				And when we came to Tenedos we paid

				 				Our offerings to the gods and longed for home﻿—

				 				Vainly; it pleased not unpropitious Jove

				 				To favor our return, and once again

				 				He sent among us strife. A part of us

				 				Led by Ulysses, that sagacious prince,

				 				To please Atrides Agamemnon turned

				 				Their well-oared galleys back. But I, with all

				 				The vessels of the fleet that followed me,

				 				Fled on my way, perceiving that some god

				 				Was meditating evil. With us fled,

				 				Encouraging his men, the warlike son

				 				Of Tydeus. Fair-haired Menelaus came

				 				Later to us in Lesbos, where we planned

				 				For a long voyage, whether we should sail

				 				Around the rugged Chios, toward the isle

				 				Of Psyria, keeping that upon the left,

				 				Or under Chios pass beside the steeps

				 				Of windy Mimas. We besought the god

				 				That he would show a sign, and he complied,

				 				And bade us to Euboea cross the deep

				 				Right in the midst, the sooner to escape

				 				All danger. Then the wind blew strong and shrill,

				 				And swiftly o’er the fishy gulfs our fleet

				 				Flew on, and reached Geraestus in the night.

				 				There, having passed the mighty deep, we made

				 				To Neptune offerings of many a thigh

				 				Of beeves. The fourth day dawned, and now the men

				 				Of Diomed, the mighty horseman, son

				 				Of Tydeus, stopped at Argos with their fleet,

				 				While I went on to Pylos with the wind,

				 				Which never, from the moment that the god

				 				First sent it o’er the waters, ceased to blow.



			 				“So, my dear child, I reached my home, nor knew

				 				Nor heard from others who among the Greeks

				 				Was saved, or who had perished on the way.

				 				Yet what I since have heard while here I sit

				 				Within my palace thou shalt duly learn.

				 				Nor is it what I ought to keep from thee.



			 				“ ’Tis said the Myrmidonian spearmen, led

				 				By great Achilles’ famous son, returned

				 				Happily home; as happily the son

				 				Of Paeas, Philoctetes the renowned.

				 				Idomeneus brought also back to Crete

				 				All his companions who survived the war;

				 				The sea took none of them. But ye have heard,

				 				Though far away, the fate of Atreus’ son﻿—

				 				How he came home, and how Aegisthus laid

				 				A plot to slay him, yet on his own head

				 				Drew heavy punishment﻿—so fortunate

				 				It is when he who falls by murder leaves

				 				A son; for ’twas the monarch’s son who took

				 				Vengeance upon the crafty murderer

				 				Aegisthus, by whose hand Atrides died.

				 				Thou too, my friend, for thou art large of frame,

				 				And of a noble presence, be thou brave,

				 				That men in time to come may give thee praise.”



			 				Then spake discreet Telemachus again:﻿—

				 				“O Nestor, son of Neleus, pride of Greece,

				 				Ample was his revenge, and far and wide

				 				The Greeks will spread his fame to be the song

				 				Of future times. O might the gods confer

				 				On me an equal power to avenge myself

				 				On that importunate, overbearing crew

				 				Of suitors, who insult me, and devise

				 				Evil against me! But the gods deny

				 				Such fortune to my father and to me,

				 				And all that now is left me is to bear.”



			 				Again spake Nestor the Gerenian knight:﻿—

				 				“Since thou, my friend, hast spoken words which bring

				 				What I have heard to mind﻿—the rumor goes

				 				That in thy palace many suiters wait

				 				About thy mother, and in spite of thee

				 				Do grievous wrong. Now tell me; dost thou yield

				 				Willingly, or because the people, swayed

				 				By oracles, regard thee as their foe?

				 				Thy father yet may come again﻿—who knows?﻿—

				 				Alone, or with the other Greeks, to take

				 				The vengeance which these violent deeds deserve.

				 				Should blue-eyed Pallas deign to favor thee,

				 				As once she watched to guard the glorious chief

				 				Ulysses in the realm of Troy, where we,

				 				The Achaians, bore such hardships﻿—for I ne’er

				 				Have seen the gods so openly befriend

				 				A man as Pallas there befriended him﻿—

				 				Should she thus deign to favor thee and keep

				 				Watch over thee, then haply some of these

				 				Will never think of marriage rites again.”



			 				Then spake discreet Telemachus again:﻿—

				 				“O aged man! I cannot think thy words

				 				Will be fulfilled! for they import too much

				 				And they amaze me. What thou sayst I wish

				 				May come to pass, but know it cannot be,

				 				Not even though the gods should will it so.”



			 				Then thus the blue-eyed goddess, Pallas, spake:﻿—

				 				“Telemachus, what words have passed thy lips?

				 				Easily can a god, whene’er he will,

				 				In the most distant regions safely keep

				 				A man; and I would rather reach my home

				 				Securely, after many hardships borne,

				 				Than perish suddenly on my return

				 				As Agamemnon perished by the guile

				 				Of base Aegisthus and the queen. And yet

				 				The gods themselves have not the power to save

				 				Whom most they cherish from the common doom

				 				When cruel fate brings on the last long sleep.”



			 				Discreet Telemachus made answer thus:﻿—

				 				“Let us, O Mentor, talk no more of this,

				 				Though much we grieve; he never will return,

				 				For his is the black doom of death ordained

				 				By the great gods. Now suffer me to ask

				 				Of Nestor further, since to him are known,

				 				Beyond all other men, the rules of right

				 				And prudence. He has governed, so men say,

				 				Three generations, and to me he seems

				 				In aspect like the ever-living gods.

				 				O Nestor, son of Neleus, truly say

				 				How died the monarch over mighty realms,

				 				Atrides Agamemnon? Where was then

				 				His brother Menelaus? By what arts

				 				Did treacherous Aegisthus plan his death,

				 				And slay a braver warrior than himself?

				 				Was not the brother in the Achaian town

				 				Of Argos? or was he a wanderer

				 				In other lands, which made the murderer bold?”



			 				The knight, Gerenian Nestor, answered thus:﻿—

				 				“I will tell all and truly. Thou hast guessed

				 				Rightly and as it happened. Had the son

				 				Of Atreus, fair-haired Menelaus, come

				 				From Troy, and found Aegisthus yet alive

				 				Within the palace, he had never flung

				 				The loose earth on his corpse, but dogs and birds

				 				Had preyed upon it, lying in the fields

				 				Far from the city, and no woman’s voice

				 				Of all the Greeks had raised the wail for him.

				 				Great was the crime he plotted. We were yet

				 				Afar, enduring the hard toils of war,

				 				While he, securely couched in his retreat

				 				At Argos, famed for steeds, with flattering words

				 				Corrupted Agamemnon’s queen. At first

				 				The noble Clytemnestra turned away

				 				With horror from the crime; for yet her heart

				 				Was right, and by her side there stood a bard

				 				With whom Atrides, when he went to Troy,

				 				Had left his wife with many an earnest charge.

				 				But when the gods and fate had spread a net

				 				For his destruction, then Aegisthus bore

				 				The minstrel to a desert isle, and there

				 				Left him to be devoured by birds of prey,

				 				And led the queen, as willing as himself,

				 				To his own palace. Many a victim’s thigh

				 				Upon the hallowed altars of the gods

				 				He offered, many a gift of ornaments

				 				Woven or wrought in gold he hung within

				 				Their temples, since at length the mighty end

				 				For which he hardly dared to hope was gained.

				 				We sailed together from the coast of Troy,

				 				Atrides, Menelaus, and myself,

				 				Friends to each other. When the headland height

				 				Of Athens, hallowed Sunium, met our eyes,

				 				Apollo smote with his still shafts, and slew

				 				Phrontis, Onetor’s son, who steered the barque

				 				Of Menelaus, holding in his hands

				 				The rudder as the galley scudded on﻿—

				 				And skilled was he beyond all other men

				 				To guide a vessel when the storm was high.

				 				So there did Menelaus stay his course,

				 				Though eager to go on, that he might lay

				 				His friend in earth and pay the funeral rites.

				 				But setting sail again with all his fleet

				 				Upon the dark-blue sea, all-seeing Jove

				 				Decreed a perilous voyage. He sent forth

				 				His shrill-voiced hurricane, and heaped on high

				 				The mountain waves. There, scattering the barques

				 				Far from each other, part he drove to Crete,

				 				Where the Cydonians dwell, beside the stream

				 				Of Jardanus. A smooth and pointed rock

				 				Just on the bounds of Gortys stands amidst

				 				The dark-blue deep. The south wind thitherward

				 				Sweeps a great sea towards Phoestus, and against

				 				The headland on the left, where that small rock

				 				Meets and withstands the mighty wave. The ships

				 				Were driven on this, and scarce the crews escaped

				 				With life; the ships were dashed against the crags

				 				And wrecked, save five, and these, with their black prows,

				 				Were swept toward Egypt by the winds and waves.



			 				“Thus adding to his wealth and gathering gold

				 				He roamed the ocean in his ships among

				 				Men of strange speech. Aegisthus meantime planned

				 				His guilty deeds at home; he slew the king

				 				Atrides, and the people took his yoke.

				 				Seven years in rich Mycenae he bore rule,

				 				And on the eighth, to his destruction, came

				 				The nobly-born Orestes, just returned

				 				From Athens, and cut off that man of blood,

				 				The crafty wretch Aegisthus, by whose hand

				 				Fell his illustrious father. Then he bade

				 				The Argives to the solemn burial-feast

				 				Of his bad mother and the craven wretch

				 				Aegisthus. Menelaus, that same day,

				 				The great in war, arrived, and brought large wealth﻿—

				 				So large his galleys could contain no more.

				 				“And thou, my friend, be thou not long away,

				 				Wandering from home, thy rich possessions left,

				 				And in thy palace-halls a lawless crew,

				 				Lest they devour thy substance, and divide

				 				Thy goods, and thou have crossed the sea in vain.

				 				Yet must I counsel and enjoin on thee

				 				To visit Menelaus, who has come

				 				Just now from lands and nations of strange men,

				 				Whence one could hardly hope for a return;

				 				Whom once the tempest’s violence had driven

				 				Into that great wide sea o’er which the birds

				 				Of heaven could scarce fly hither in a year,

				 				Such is its fearful vastness. Go thou now,

				 				Thou with thy ship and friends; or if thou choose

				 				The way by land, a car and steeds are here,

				 				And here my sons to guide thee to the town

				 				Of hallowed Lacedaemon, there to find

				 				The fair-haired Menelaus. Earnestly

				 				Beseech of him that he declare the truth.

				 				Falsely he will not speak, for he is wise.”



			 				He spake; the sun went down; the darkness crept

				 				Over the earth, and blue-eyed Pallas said:﻿—

				 				“Most wisely hast thou spoken, ancient man.

				 				Now cut ye out the tongues, and mingle wine,

				 				That we to Neptune and the other gods

				 				May pour libations, and then think of rest;

				 				For now the hour is come; the light is gone,

				 				Nor at a feast in honor of the gods

				 				Should we long sit, but in good time withdraw.”



			 				Jove’s daughter spake; they hearkened to her words;

				 				The heralds came to them, and on their hands

				 				Poured water; boys began to fill the bowls

				 				To the hard brim, and ministered to each

				 				From left to right. Then threw they to the flames

				 				The victims’ tongues, and, rising, poured on earth

				 				Wine to the gods; and when that rite was paid,

				 				And when their thirst was satiate, Pallas rose

				 				With nobly-born Telemachus to go

				 				To their good ship, but Nestor still detained

				 				The twain, and chidingly bespake them thus:﻿—



			 				“Now Jove and all the other gods forbid

				 				That ye should go from me to your good ship,

				 				As from some half-clad wretch, too poor to own

				 				Mantles and blankets in whose soft warm folds

				 				He and his guests might sleep; but I have both﻿—

				 				Mantles and blankets﻿—beautifully wrought,

				 				And never shall the son of that great man

				 				Ulysses lie upon a galley’s deck

				 				While I am living. After me I hope

				 				My sons, who dwell within my palace-halls,

				 				Will duly welcome all who enter here.”



			 				And thus again the blue-eyed Pallas spake:﻿—

				 				“Well hast thou said, my aged friend, and well

				 				Doth it become Telemachus to heed

				 				Thy words, for that were best. Let him remain

				 				With thee and sleep in thine abode, while I

				 				Repair to our black ship, encouraging

				 				The crew, and setting them their proper tasks,

				 				For I am eldest of them all; the rest

				 				Are young men yet, and moved by friendship joined

				 				Our enterprise; the peers in age are they

				 				Of the large-souled Telemachus. Tonight

				 				I sleep within the hull of our black ship,

				 				And sail with early morning for the land

				 				Of the Cauconians, large of soul, from whom

				 				A debt is due me, neither new nor small.

				 				Send meantime from thy palace in a car,

				 				And with thy son, this youth, and be the steeds

				 				The fleetest and the strongest in thy stalls.”



			 				The blue-eyed Pallas, having spoken thus,

				 				Passed like an eagle out of sight, and all

				 				Were seized with deep amazement as they saw.

				 				The aged monarch, wondering at the sight,

				 				Took by the hand Telemachus, and said:﻿—



			 				“Of craven temper, and unapt for war,

				 				O friend, thou canst not be, since thus the gods

				 				Attend and guide thee in thy youth. And this,

				 				Of all the gods whose dwelling is in heaven,

				 				Can be no other than the spoiler-queen

				 				Pallas, the child of Jove, who also held

				 				Thy father in such eminent esteem

				 				Among the Grecians. Deign to favor us,

				 				O queen! bestow on me and on my sons

				 				And on my venerable spouse the meed

				 				Of special glory. I will bring to thee

				 				A sacrifice, a broad-horned yearling steer,

				 				Which never man hath tamed or led beneath

				 				The yoke. Her will I bring with gilded horns,

				 				And lay an offering on thine altar-fires.”



			 				Such were his words, and Pallas heard the prayer,

				 				And then Gerenian Nestor led the way,

				 				And with his sons and sons-in-law approached

				 				His glorious palace. When they came within

				 				The monarch’s sumptuous halls, each took his place

				 				In order on the couches and the thrones.

				 				The old man mingled for them as they came

				 				A bowl of delicate wine, eleven years old,

				 				Drawn by the damsel cupbearer, who took

				 				Its cover from the jar. The aged chief

				 				Mingled it in the bowl, and, pouring out

				 				A part to Pallas, offered earnest prayer

				 				To her, who sprang from aegis-bearing Jove.



			 				When due libations had been made, and all

				 				Drank till they wished no more, most went away,

				 				Each to his home to sleep; but Nestor made

				 				Telemachus, the son of the great chief

				 				Ulysses, rest upon a sumptuous couch

				 				Within the echoing hall, and near to him

				 				The chief of squadrons, skilled to wield the spear,

				 				Peisistratus, who only of his sons

				 				Abode in Nestor’s halls unwedded yet;

				 				While in an inner room of that tall pile

				 				The monarch slumbered on a bed of state,

				 				Decked for him by the labors of his queen.



			 				Soon as the daughter of the dawn appeared,

				 				The rosy-fingered Morning, Nestor left

				 				His bed and went abroad, and took his seat

				 				On smooth white stones before his lofty doors,

				 				That glistened as with oil, on which before

				 				Sat Neleus, wise in council as the gods.

				 				But he had yielded to the will of fate,

				 				And passed into the Underworld. Now sat

				 				Gerenian Nestor in his father’s place,

				 				The guardian of the Greeks. Around his seat,

				 				Just from the chambers of their rest, his sons

				 				Echephron, Stratius, and Aretus came,

				 				Perseus, and Thrasymedes; after these

				 				Came brave Peisistratus, the sixth and last.

				 				They led Telemachus, the godlike youth,

				 				And placed him near them. The Gerenian knight

				 				Nestor began, and thus bespake his sons:﻿—



			 				“Do quickly what I ask, dear sons, and aid

				 				To render Pallas, first of all the gods,

				 				Propitious﻿—Pallas, who has deigned to come,

				 				And at a solemn feast to manifest

				 				Herself to me. Let one of you go forth

				 				Among the fields, and bring a heifer thence,

				 				Led by the herdsman. To the dark-hulled ship

				 				Of the large-souled Telemachus I bid

				 				Another son repair, and bring the crew

				 				Save only two; and let another call

				 				Laërceus hither, skilled to work in gold,

				 				That he may plate with gold the heifer’s horns.

				 				Let all the rest remain to bid the maids

				 				Within prepare a sumptuous feast, and bring

				 				Seats, wood, and limpid water from the fount.”



			 				He spake, and all were busy. From the field

				 				The bullock came; from the swift-sailing barque

				 				Came the companions of the gallant youth

				 				Telemachus; with all his implements﻿—

				 				Hammer and anvil, and well-jointed tongs﻿—

				 				With which he wrought, the goldsmith also came,

				 				And to be present at the sacred rites

				 				Pallas came likewise. Nestor, aged knight,

				 				Brought forth the gold; the artisan prepared

				 				The metal, and about the bullock’s horns

				 				Wound it, that Pallas might with pleasure see

				 				The victim so adorned. Then Stratius grasped

				 				The horns, and, aided by Echephron, led

				 				The bullock. From his room Aretus brought

				 				A laver filled with water in one hand,

				 				And in the other hand a canister

				 				Of cakes, while Thrasymedes, great in war,

				 				Stood near with a sharp axe, about to smite

				 				The victim. Perseus held a vase to catch

				 				The blood, while Nestor, aged horseman, took

				 				Water and cakes, and offering first a part,

				 				And flinging the shorn forelock to the flames,

				 				Prayed to the goddess Pallas fervently.



			 				And now, when they had prayed, and flung the cakes,

				 				The large-souled Thrasymedes, Nestor’s son,

				 				Struck, where he stood, the blow; the bullock’s strength

				 				Gave way. At once the daughters of the king,

				 				And his sons’ wives, and queen Eurydicè﻿—

				 				Nestor’s chaste wife, and daughter eldest born

				 				Of Clymenus, broke forth in shrilly cries.

				 				From the great earth the sons then lifted up

				 				And held the victim’s head. Peisistratus,

				 				The chief of squadrons, slew it. When the blood

				 				Had ceased to flow, and life had left its limbs,

				 				They quickly severed joint from joint; they hewed

				 				The thighs away, and duly covered them

				 				With caul, a double fold, on which they laid

				 				Raw strips of flesh. The aged monarch burned

				 				These over the cleft wood, and poured dark wine

				 				Upon them, while beside him stood the youths

				 				With five-pronged spits; and when the thighs were burned

				 				And entrails tasted, all the rest they carved

				 				Into small portions and transfixed with spits,

				 				And roasted, holding the sharp spits in hand.

				 				Meantime, fair Polycastè, youngest born

				 				Of Nestor’s daughters, gave Telemachus

				 				The bath; and after he had bathed she shed

				 				A rich oil over him, and in a cloak

				 				Of noble texture and a tunic robed

				 				The prince, who, like a god in presence, left

				 				The bath, and took his place where Nestor sat,

				 				The shepherd of the people. When the youths

				 				Had roasted well and from the spits withdrawn

				 				The flesh, they took their places at the feast.

				 				Then rose up chosen men, and poured the wine

				 				Into the cups of gold; and when at length

				 				The thirst and appetite were both allayed,

				 				The knight, Gerenian Nestor, thus began:﻿—



			 				“Rise now, my sons; join to the bright-haired steeds

				 				My car, and let Telemachus depart.”



			 				He spake; they hearkened and obeyed, and straight

				 				Yoked the swift horses to the car. Then came

				 				The matron of the household, laying bread

				 				And wine within the car, and dainties such

				 				As make a prince’s fare. Telemachus

				 				Then climbed into the sumptuous seat. The son

				 				Of Nestor and the chief of armed bands,

				 				Peisistratus, climbed also, took his place

				 				Beside him, grasped the reins, and with the lash

				 				Urged on the coursers. Not unwillingly

				 				They darted toward the plain, and left behind

				 				The lofty Pylos. All that day they shook

				 				The yoke on both their necks. The sun went down;

				 				The highways lay in darkness when they came

				 				To Pherae and the abode of Diocles,

				 				Son of Orsilochus, who claimed to be

				 				The offspring of Alpheius. They with him

				 				Found welcome there, and there that night they slept.



			 				And when the rosy-fingered Morn appeared,

				 				They yoked the horses, climbed the shining car,

				 				And issued from the palace gate beneath

				 				The sounding portico. Peisistratus

				 				Wielded the lash to urge the coursers on,

				 				And not unwillingly they flew and reached

				 				A land of harvests. Here the travellers found

				 				Their journey’s end, so swiftly those fleet steeds

				 				Had borne them on. And now the sun went down,

				 				And darkness gathered over all the ways.





						Book 						IV


					Conference of Telemachus and Menelaus


				 				Arrival of Telemachus and his companion at Sparta﻿—A wedding; the marriage of the daughter of Menelaus﻿—Helen in Sparta﻿—Entertainment of the guests﻿—Helen’s account of her return to her husband﻿—The Trojan horse﻿—Narrative of the visit of Menelaus to Egypt, in order to consult the sea-god, Proteus﻿—Menelaus informed by him that Ulysses is detained by Calypso in her island﻿—Plot of the suitors to lie in wait for Telemachus on his voyage and destroy him﻿—Penelope visited and consoled by Pallas in a dream.





				They came to Lacedaemon’s valley, seamed

				 				With dells, and to the palace of its king,

				 				The glorious Menelaus, whom they found

				 				Within, and at a wedding banquet, made

				 				Both for his blameless daughter and his son,

				 				And many guests. Her he must send away,

				 				Bride of the son of that invincible chief,

				 				Achilles. He betrothed her while in Troy,

				 				And gave his kingly word, and now the gods

				 				Fulfilled it by the marriage. He was now

				 				Sending her forth, with steeds and cars, to reach

				 				The noble city of the Myrmidons,

				 				Where ruled her consort. From the Spartan coast

				 				He brought Alector’s daughter for his son,

				 				The gallant Megapenthes, borne to him

				 				By a handmaiden in his later years.

				 				For not to Helen had the gods vouchsafed

				 				Yet other offspring, after she had brought

				 				A lovely daughter forth, Hermione,

				 				Like golden Venus both in face and form.



			 				So banqueting the neighbors and the friends

				 				Of glorious Menelaus sat beneath

				 				The lofty ceiling of those spacious halls,

				 				Delighted with the feast. A sacred bard

				 				Amidst them touched the harp and sang to them

				 				While, as the song began, two dancers sprang

				 				Into the midst and trod the measure there



			 				But they﻿—the hero-youth Telemachus

				 				And Nestor’s eminent son﻿—were at the gate,

				 				And standing in the entrance with their steeds.

				 				The worthy Eteoneus, coming forth﻿—

				 				The trusty servant of the glorious son

				 				Of Atreus﻿—saw, and hastening thence to tell

				 				The shepherd of the people, through the hall

				 				He came to him, and spake these winged words:﻿—



			 				“O Menelaus, foster-child of Jove,

				 				Two strangers have arrived, two men who seem

				 				Descended from almighty Jupiter.

				 				Shall we then loose the harness from their steeds,

				 				Or bid them elsewhere seek a friendly host?”



			 				The fair-haired king indignantly replied:﻿—

				 				“Nay, Eteoneus, thou hast not been wont.

				 				Son of Boëthus, thus to play the fool.

				 				Thou pratest idly, like a child. Ourselves

				 				Have sat, as guests, at generous banquets given

				 				By other men, when journeying hitherward

				 				In hope that Jove might grant a respite here

				 				From our disasters. Hasten, then, to loose

				 				The steeds, and bring the strangers to the feast.”



			 				He spake; the attendant hastened forth and called

				 				The other trusty servitors, with charge

				 				To follow. They unyoked the sweaty steeds,

				 				And bound them to the stalls, and gave them oats,

				 				With which they mingled the white barley-grains,

				 				And close against the shining wall they placed

				 				The car, and then they led the guests within

				 				The sumptuous palace. Entering, these admired

				 				The palace of the foster-child of Jove,

				 				For like the splendor of the sun and moon

				 				Its glory was. They with delighted eyes

				 				Gazed, and, descending to the polished baths,

				 				They bathed. The attendant maids who at the bath

				 				Had ministered, anointing them with oil,

				 				Arrayed the stranger guests in fleecy cloaks

				 				And tunics. Each sat down upon a throne

				 				Near to Atrides. Now a handmaid brought

				 				A beautiful ewer of gold, and laver wrought

				 				Of silver, and poured water for their hands,

				 				And spread a polished table near their seat;

				 				The reverend matron of the household came

				 				With bread, and set before them many a dish

				 				Gathered from all the feast. The carver next

				 				Brought chargers lifted high, and in them meats

				 				Of every flavor, and before them placed

				 				Beakers of gold. The fair-haired monarch gave

				 				His hand to each, and then bespake them thus:﻿—



			 				“Now taste our banquet and rejoice, and when

				 				Ye are refreshed with food we will inquire

				 				Who ye may be; for ye are not of those

				 				Whose race degenerates, ye are surely born

				 				Of sceptred kings, the favorites of Jove.

				 				Ignoble men have never sons like you.”



			 				Thus having said, and taking in his hands

				 				A fatling bullock’s chine, which menials brought

				 				Roasted, and placed beside the king in sign

				 				Of honor, this he laid before his guests.

				 				And they put forth their hands and banqueted;

				 				And when the calls of hunger and of thirst

				 				At length were stilled, Telemachus inclined

				 				His head toward Nestor’s son, that no one else

				 				Might listen to his words, and thus he said:﻿—



			 				“See, son of Nestor, my beloved friend,

				 				In all these echoing rooms the sheen of brass,

				 				Of gold, of amber, and of ivory;

				 				Such is the palace of Olympian Jove

				 				Within its walls. How many things are here

				 				Of priceless worth! I wonder as I gaze.”



			 				The fair-haired Menelaus heard him speak,

				 				And thus accosted both with winged words:﻿—



			 				“Dear sons, no mortal man may vie with Jove,

				 				Whose palace and possessions never know

				 				Decay, but other men may vie or not

				 				In wealth with me. ’Twas after suffering

				 				And wandering long that in my fleet I brought

				 				My wealth with me, and landed on this coast

				 				In the eighth year. For I had roamed afar

				 				To Cyprus and to Phoenicè, and where

				 				The Egyptians dwell, and Ethiopia’s sons,

				 				And the Sidonians, and the Erembian race,

				 				And to the coast of Lybia, where the lambs

				 				Are yeaned with budding horns. There do the ewes

				 				Thrice in the circle of the year bring forth

				 				Their young. There both the master of the herd

				 				And herdsman know no lack of cheese, or flesh,

				 				Or of sweet milk; for there the herds yield milk

				 				The whole year round. While I was roaming thus,

				 				And gathering store of wealth, another slew

				 				My brother, unforewarned, and through the fraud

				 				Of his own guilty consort. Therefore small

				 				Is the content I find in bearing rule

				 				O’er these possessions. Ye have doubtless heard

				 				This from your parents, be they who they may;

				 				For much have I endured, and I have lost

				 				A palace, a most noble dwelling-place,

				 				Full of things rare and precious. Even now

				 				Would I possessed within my palace here

				 				But the third part of these; and would that they

				 				Were yet alive who perished on the plain

				 				Of Troy afar from Argos and its steeds!

				 				Yet while I grieve and while I mourn them all,

				 				Here, sitting in my palace, I by turns

				 				Indulge my heart in weeping, and by turns

				 				I pause, for with continual sorrow comes

				 				A weariness of spirit. Yet, in truth,

				 				For none of all those warriors, though their fate

				 				Afflicts me sorely, do I so much grieve

				 				As for one hero. When I think of him,

				 				The feast and couch are joyless, since, of all

				 				The Achaian chiefs, none brought so much to pass

				 				As did Ulysses, both in what he wrought

				 				And what he suffered. Great calamities

				 				Fell to his lot in life, and to my own

				 				Grief for his sake that cannot be consoled.

				 				Long has he been divided from his friends,

				 				And whether he be living now or dead

				 				We know not. Old Laertes, the sage queen

				 				Penelope, and young Telemachus,

				 				Whom, when he went to war he left newborn

				 				At home, are sorrowing somewhere for his sake.”



			 				He spake, and woke anew the young man’s grief

				 				For his lost father. From his eyelids fell

				 				Tears at the hearing of his father’s name,

				 				And with both hands he held before his eyes

				 				The purple mantle. Menelaus saw

				 				His tears, and pondered, doubting which were best﻿—

				 				To let the stranger of his own accord

				 				Speak of his father, or to question him

				 				At first, and then to tell him all he knew.



			 				As thus he pondered, Helen, like in form

				 				To Dian of the golden distaff, left

				 				Her high-roofed chamber, where the air was sweet

				 				With perfumes, and approached. Adrasta placed

				 				A seat for her of costly workmanship;

				 				Alcippè brought a mat of soft light wool,

				 				And Phylo with a silver basket came,

				 				Given by Alcandra, wife of Polybus,

				 				Who dwelt at Thebes, in Egypt, and whose house

				 				Was rich in things of price. Two silver baths

				 				He gave to Menelaus, tripods two,

				 				And talents ten of gold. His wife bestowed

				 				Beautiful gifts on Helen﻿—one of gold,

				 				A distaff; one a silver basket edged

				 				With gold and round in form. This Phylo brought

				 				Heaped with spun yarn and placed before the queen;

				 				Upon it lay the distaff, wrapped in wool

				 				Of color like the violet. Helen there

				 				Sat down, a footstool at her feet, and straight

				 				Questioned with earnest words her husband thus:﻿—



			 				“Say, Menelaus, foster-child of Jove,

				 				Is it yet known what lineage these men claim﻿—

				 				These visitants? And what I now shall say,

				 				Will it be false or true? Yet must I speak.

				 				Woman or man I think I never saw

				 				So like another as this youth, on whom

				 				I look with deep astonishment, is like

				 				Telemachus, the son whom our great chief

				 				Ulysses left at home a tender babe

				 				When ye Achaians for my guilty sake

				 				Went forth to wage the bloody war with Troy.”



			 				And fair-haired Menelaus answered her:﻿—

				 				“Yea, wife, so deem I as it seems to thee.

				 				Such are his feet, his hands, the cast of the eye,

				 				His head, the hair upon his brow. Just now,

				 				In speaking of Ulysses, as I told

				 				How he had toiled and suffered for my sake,

				 				The stranger held the purple cloak before

				 				His eyes, and from the lids dropped bitter tears.”



			 				Peisistratus, the son of Nestor, spake

				 				In answer: “Menelaus, foster-child

				 				Of Jove and son of Atreus! sovereign king!

				 				He is, as thou hast said, that hero’s son;

				 				But he is modest, and he deems that ill

				 				It would become him, on arriving here,

				 				If he should venture in discourse while thou

				 				Art present, in whose voice we take delight

				 				As if it were the utterance of a god.

				 				The knight Gerenian Nestor sent me forth

				 				To guide him hither﻿—for he earnestly

				 				Desired to see thee, that thou mightest give

				 				Counsel in what he yet should say or do.

				 				For bitterly a son, who finds at home

				 				No others to befriend him, must lament

				 				The absence of a father. So it is

				 				With young Telemachus; for far away

				 				His father is, and in the land are none

				 				Who have the power to shelter him from wrong.”



			 				The fair-haired Menelaus answered thus:﻿—

				 				“O wonder! Then the son of one most dear,

				 				Who for my sake so oft has braved and borne

				 				The conflicts of the battlefield, hath come

				 				Beneath my roof. I thought that I should greet

				 				His father with a warmer welcome here

				 				Than any other of the Argive race,

				 				When Jove the Olympian Thunderer should grant

				 				A safe return to us across the deep

				 				In our good ships. I would have founded here

				 				For him a city in Argos, and have built

				 				Dwellings, and would have brought from Ithaca

				 				Him and his son, and all his wealth and all

				 				His people. To this end I would have caused

				 				Some neighboring district where my sway is owned

				 				To be dispeopled. Dwelling here we oft

				 				Should then have met each other, and no cause

				 				Would e’er have parted us, two faithful friends

				 				Delighting in each other, till at last

				 				Came Death’s black cloud to wrap us in its shade.

				 				A god, no doubt, hath seen in this a good

				 				Too great for us, and thus to him alone,

				 				Unhappy man! denied a safe return.”



			 				He spake; his words awoke in every heart

				 				Grief for the absent hero’s sake. Then wept

				 				The Argive Helen, child of Jove; then wept

				 				Telemachus; nor tearless were the eyes

				 				Of Nestor’s son, for to his mind arose

				 				The memory of the good Antilochus,

				 				Slain by the bright Aurora’s eminent son;

				 				Of him he thought, and spake these winged words:﻿—



			 				“O son of Atreus! aged Nestor saith,

				 				When in his palace we discourse of thee

				 				And ask each other’s thought, that thou art wise

				 				Beyond all other men. Now, if thou mayst,

				 				Indulge me, for not willingly I weep

				 				Thus at the evening feast, and soon will Morn,

				 				Child of the Dawn, appear. I do not blame

				 				This sorrow for whoever meets his fate

				 				And dies; the only honors we can pay

				 				To those unhappy mortals is to shred

				 				Our locks away, and wet our cheeks with tears.

				 				I lost a brother, not the least in worth

				 				Among the Argives, whom thou must have seen.

				 				I knew him not: I never saw his face;

				 				Yet is it said Antilochus excelled

				 				The others; swift of foot, and brave in war.”



			 				The fair-haired Menelaus answered him:﻿—

				 				“Since thou my friend hast spoken thus, as one

				 				Discreet in word and deed, of riper years

				 				Than thou, might speak and act﻿—for thou art born

				 				Of such a father, and thy words are wise﻿—

				 				And easy is it to discern the son

				 				Of one on whom Saturnius has bestowed

				 				Both at the birth-hour and in wedded life

				 				His blessing; as he gives to Nestor now

				 				A calm old age that lapses pleasantly,

				 				Within his palace-halls, from day to day,

				 				And sons wise-minded, mighty with the spear﻿—

				 				Then let us lay aside this sudden grief

				 				That has o’ertaken us, and only think

				 				Of banqueting. Let water now be poured

				 				Upon our hands; there will be time enough

				 				Tomorrow for discourse; Telemachus

				 				And I will then engage in mutual talk.”



			 				He spake, Asphalion, who with diligent heed

				 				Served the great Menelaus, on their hands

				 				Poured water, and they shared the meats that lay

				 				Upon the board. But Helen, Jove-born dame,

				 				Had other thoughts, and with the wine they drank

				 				Mingled a drug, an antidote to grief

				 				And anger, bringing quick forgetfulness

				 				Of all life’s evils. Whoso drinks, when once

				 				It is infused and in the cup, that day

				 				Shall never wet his cheeks with tears, although

				 				His father and his mother lie in death,

				 				Nor though his brother or beloved son

				 				Fall butchered by the sword before his eyes.

				 				Such sovereign drugs she had, that child of Jove,

				 				Given her by Polydamna, wife of Thon,

				 				A dame of Egypt, where the bounteous soil

				 				Brings forth abundantly its potent herbs,

				 				Of healing some and some of bane, and where

				 				Dwell the physicians who excel in skill

				 				All other men, for they are of the race

				 				Of Paeon. Now when Helen in the cups

				 				Had placed the drug, and bidden them to pour

				 				The wine upon it, thus she spake again:﻿—



			 				“Atrides Menelaus, reared by Jove,

				 				And ye the sons of heroes!﻿—Jupiter

				 				The sovereign, gives, at pleasure, good and ill

				 				To one or to another, for his power

				 				Is infinite﻿—now sitting in these halls,

				 				Feast and enjoy free converse. I will speak

				 				What suits the occasion. I could not relate,

				 				I could not even name, the many toils

				 				Borne by Ulysses, stout of heart. I speak

				 				Only of what that valiant warrior did

				 				And suffered once in Troy, where ye of Greece

				 				Endured such hardships. He had given himself

				 				Unseemly stripes, and o’er his shoulders flung

				 				Vile garments like a slave’s, and entered thus

				 				The enemy’s town, and walked its spacious streets.

				 				Another man he seemed in that disguise﻿—

				 				A beggar, though when at the Achaian fleet

				 				So different was the semblance that he wore.

				 				He entered Ilium thus transformed, and none

				 				Knew who it was that passed, but I perceived,

				 				And questioned him; he turned my quest aside

				 				With crafty answers. After I had seen

				 				The bath administered, anointed him

				 				And clothed him, and had sworn a solemn oath

				 				Not to reveal his visit to the men

				 				Of Ilium till he reached again the tents

				 				And galleys, then he opened to me all

				 				The plans of the Achaians. Leaving me,

				 				On his return he slew with his long spear

				 				Full many a Trojan, and in safety reached

				 				The Argive camp with tidings for the host.

				 				Then wept aloud the Trojan dames, but I

				 				Was glad at heart, for I already longed

				 				For my old home, and deeply I deplored

				 				The evil fate that Venus brought on me,

				 				Who led me thither from my own dear land,

				 				And from my daughter and my marriage-bower,

				 				And from my lawful spouse, in whom I missed

				 				No noble gift of person or of mind.”



			 				Then fair-haired Menelaus said to her:﻿—

				 				“All thou hast spoken, woman, is most true.

				 				Of many a valiant warrior I have known

				 				The counsels and the purposes, and far

				 				Have roamed in many lands, but never yet

				 				My eyes have looked on such another man

				 				As was Ulysses, of a heart so bold

				 				And such endurance. Witness what he did

				 				And bore, the heroic man, what time we sat,

				 				The bravest of the Argives, pent within

				 				The wooden horse, about to bring to Troy

				 				Slaughter and death. Thou earnest to the place,

				 				Moved, as it seemed, by some divinity

				 				Who thought to give the glory of the day

				 				To Troy. Deiphobus, the godlike chief,

				 				Was with thee. Thrice about the hollow frame

				 				That held the ambush thou didst walk and touch

				 				Its sides, and call the Achaian chiefs by name,

				 				And imitate the voices of the wives

				 				Of all the Argives. Diomed and I

				 				Sat with the great Ulysses in the midst,

				 				And with him heard thy call, and rose at once

				 				To sally forth or answer from within;

				 				But he forbade, impatient as we were,

				 				And so restrained us. All the Achaian chiefs

				 				Kept silence save Anticlus, who alone

				 				Began to speak, when, with his powerful hands,

				 				Ulysses pressed together instantly

				 				The opening lips, and saved us all, and thus

				 				Held them till Pallas lured thee from the spot.”



			 				Then spake discreet Telemachus again:﻿—

				 				“Atrides Menelaus, reared by Jove,

				 				Ruler of tribes! the harder was his lot,

				 				Since even thus he could not shun the stroke

				 				Of death, not though a heart of steel were his.

				 				But now dismiss us to our beds, that there,

				 				Couched softly, we may welcome balmy sleep.”



			 				He spake, and Argive Helen called her maids

				 				To make up couches in the portico,

				 				And throw fair purple blankets over them,

				 				And tapestry above, and cover all

				 				With shaggy cloaks. Forth from the palace halls

				 				They went with torches, and made ready soon

				 				The couches; thither heralds led the guests.

				 				There in the vestibule Telemachus,

				 				The hero, and with him the eminent son

				 				Of Nestor, took their rest. Meanwhile the son

				 				Of Atreus lay within an inner room

				 				Of that magnificent pile, and near to him

				 				The glorious lady, long-robed Helen, slept.

				 				But when at length the daughter of the Dawn,

				 				The rosy-fingered Morning, brought her light,

				 				Then Menelaus, great in battle, rose,

				 				Put on his garments, took his trenchant sword,

				 				And, having hung it on his shoulder, laced

				 				The shapely sandals to his shining feet,

				 				And issued from his chamber like a god

				 				In aspect. Near Telemachus he took

				 				His seat, and calling him by name he spake:﻿—



			 				“What urgent cause, my brave Telemachus,

				 				Brings thee to sacred Lacedaemon o’er

				 				The breast of the great ocean? Frankly say,

				 				Is it a private or a public need?”



			 				And thus discreet Telemachus replied:﻿—

				 				“Atrides Menelaus, reared by Jove,

				 				Ruler of nations! I am come to ask

				 				News of my father, if thou knowest aught.

				 				My heritage is wasting; my rich fields

				 				Are made a desolation. Enemies

				 				Swarm in my palace, and from day to day

				 				Slaughter my flocks and slow-paced horned herds;

				 				My mother’s suitors they, and measureless

				 				Their insolence. And therefore am I come

				 				To clasp thy knees, and pray thee to relate

				 				The manner of my father’s sorrowful death

				 				As thou hast seen it with thine eyes, or heard

				 				Its story from some wandering man﻿—for sure

				 				His mother brought him forth to wretchedness

				 				Beyond the common lot. I ask thee not

				 				To soften aught in the sad history

				 				Through tenderness to me, or kind regard,

				 				But tell me plainly all that thou dost know;

				 				And I beseech thee, if at any time

				 				My father, good Ulysses, brought to pass

				 				Aught that he undertook for thee in word

				 				Or act while ye were in the realm of Troy,

				 				Where the Greeks suffered sorely, bear it now

				 				In mind, and let me have the naked truth.”



			 				Then Menelaus of the amber locks

				 				Drew a deep sigh, and thus in answer said:﻿—

				 				“Heavens! they would climb into a brave man’s bed,

				 				These craven weaklings. But as when a hart

				 				Has hid her newborn suckling fawns within

				 				The lair of some fierce lion, and gone forth

				 				Herself to range the mountainsides and feed

				 				Among the grassy lawns, the lion comes

				 				Back to the place and brings them sudden death,

				 				So will Ulysses bring a bloody fate

				 				Upon the suitor crew. O father Jove,

				 				And Pallas, and Apollo! I could wish

				 				That now, with prowess such as once was his

				 				When he, of yore, in Lesbos nobly built,

				 				Rising to strive with Philomela’s son,

				 				In wrestling threw him heavily, and all

				 				The Greeks rejoiced, Ulysses might engage

				 				The suitors. Short were then their term of life,

				 				And bitter would the nuptial banquet be.

				 				Now for the questions thou hast put, and craved

				 				From me a true reply, I will not seek

				 				To pass them by with talk of other things,

				 				Nor yet deceive thee, but of all that once

				 				Was told me by the Ancient of the Deep,

				 				Whose words are truth, I shall keep nothing back.



			 				“In Egypt still, though longing to come home,

				 				The gods detained me; for I had not paid

				 				The sacrifice of chosen hecatombs,

				 				And ever do the gods require of us

				 				Remembrance of their laws. There is an isle

				 				Within the billowy sea before you reach

				 				The coast of Egypt﻿—Pharos is its name﻿—

				 				At such a distance as a ship could pass

				 				In one whole day with a shrill breeze astern.

				 				A sheltered haven lies within that isle,

				 				Whence the good ships go forth with fresh supplies

				 				Of water. There the gods constrained my stay

				 				For twenty days, and never in that time

				 				Blew favoring winds across the waters, such

				 				As bear the galley over the great deep.

				 				Now would our stores of food have been consumed,

				 				Now would the courage of my men have died,

				 				Had not a goddess pitied me, and come

				 				To my relief, by name Eidothea, born

				 				To the great Proteus, Ancient of the Deep.

				 				For she was moved by my distress, and came

				 				To me while I was wandering alone,

				 				Apart from all the rest. They through the isle

				 				Roamed everywhere from place to place, and, pinched

				 				With hunger, threw the hook for fish. She came,

				 				And, standing near, accosted me and said:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Stranger, thou art an idiot, or at least

				 				Of careless mood, or else art willingly

				 				Neglectful, and art pleased with suffering,

				 				That thou dost linger in this isle so long

				 				And find no means to leave it, while the hearts

				 				Of thy companions faint with the delay.’



			 				“She spake, and I replied: ‘Whoe’er thou art,

				 				goddess, let me say, not willingly

				 				I linger here. I surely must have sinned

				 				Against the immortal dwellers of high heaven;

				 				But tell me﻿—for the gods know all things﻿—who

				 				Of all the immortals holds me windbound here,

				 				Hindering my voyage; tell me also how

				 				To reach my home across the fishy deep.’



			 				“I ended, and the glorious goddess said

				 				In answer: ‘Stranger, I will truly speak;

				 				The deathless Ancient of the Deep, whose words

				 				Are ever true, Egyptian Proteus, oft

				 				Here makes his haunt. To him are fully known﻿—

				 				For he is Neptune’s subject﻿—all the depths

				 				Of the great ocean. It is said I owe

				 				To him my birth. If him thou canst insnare

				 				And seize, he will disclose to thee thy way

				 				And all its distances, and tell thee how

				 				To reach thy home across the fishy deep;

				 				And further will reveal, if so he choose,

				 				O foster-child of Jove, whate’er of good

				 				Or ill has in thy palace come to pass,

				 				While thou wert wandering long and wearily.’



			 				“So said the goddess, and I spake again:﻿—

				 				‘Explain by what device to snare and hold

				 				The aged deity, lest he foreknow

				 				Or else suspect our purpose and escape.

				 				’Twere hard for mortals to constrain a god.’



			 				“I ended, and the glorious goddess thus

				 				Made answer: ‘When the climbing sun has reached

				 				The middle heaven, the Ancient of the Deep,

				 				Who ne’er deceives, emerges from the waves,

				 				And, covered with the dark scum of the sea,

				 				Walks forth, and in a cavern vault lies down.

				 				Thither fair Halosydna’s progeny,

				 				The sea-calves from the hoary ocean, throng,

				 				Rank with the bitter odor of the brine,

				 				And slumber near him. With the break of day

				 				I will conduct thee thither and appoint

				 				Thy place, but thou shalt choose to go with thee

				 				Three of the bravest men in thy good ships.

				 				And let me now relate the stratagems

				 				Of the old prophet. He at first will count

				 				The sea-calves, going o’er them all by fives;

				 				And when he has beheld and numbered all,

				 				Amidst them all will he lie down, as lies

				 				A shepherd midst his flock. And then, as soon

				 				As ye behold him stretched at length, exert

				 				Your utmost strength to hold him there, although

				 				He strive and struggle to escape your hands;

				 				For he will try all stratagems, and take

				 				The form of every reptile on the earth,

				 				And turn to water and to raging flame﻿—

				 				Yet hold him firmly still, and all the more

				 				Make fast the bands. When he again shall take

				 				The form in which thou sawest him asleep,

				 				Desist from force, and loose the bands that held

				 				The ancient prophet. Ask of him what god

				 				Afflicts thee thus, and by what means to cross

				 				The fishy deep and find thy home again.’

				 				“Thus having said, the goddess straightway sprang

				 				Into the billowy ocean, while I sought

				 				The galleys, where they rested on the sand,

				 				With an uneasy spirit. When I reached

				 				The ship and shore we made our evening meal.

				 				The hallowed night came down; we lay and slept

				 				Upon the sea-beach. When the Morning came,

				 				The rosy-fingered daughter of the Dawn,

				 				Forth on the border of the mighty main

				 				I went, and prayed the immortals fervently.

				 				I led three comrades, whom I trusted most

				 				In all adventures. Entering the depths

				 				Of the great sea, the goddess brought us thence

				 				Four skins of sea-calves newly flayed, that thus

				 				We might deceive her father. Then she scooped

				 				Beds for us in the sea-sand, and sat down

				 				To wait his coming. We were near to her,

				 				And there she laid us duly down, and threw

				 				A skin o’er each. Now did our ambush seem

				 				Beyond endurance, for the noisome smell

				 				Of those sea-nourished creatures sickened us;

				 				And who could bear to sleep beside a whale?

				 				But she bethought her of an antidote,

				 				A sovereign one, and so relieved us all.

				 				To each she brought ambrosia, placing it

				 				Beneath his nostrils, and the sweets it breathed

				 				O’ercame the animal odor. All the morn

				 				We waited patiently. The sea-calves came

				 				From ocean in a throng, and laid themselves

				 				In rows along the margin of the sea.

				 				At noon emerged the aged seer, and found

				 				His well-fed sea-calves. Going o’er them all

				 				He counted them, ourselves among the rest,

				 				With no misgiving of the fraud, and then

				 				He laid him down to rest. We rushed with shouts

				 				Upon him suddenly, and in our arms

				 				Caught him; nor did the aged seer forget

				 				His stratagems; and first he took the shape

				 				Of a maned lion, of a serpent next,

				 				Then of a panther, then of a huge boar,

				 				Then turned to flowing water, then became

				 				A tall tree full of leaves. With resolute hearts

				 				We held him fast, until the aged seer

				 				Was wearied out, in spite of all his wiles.

				 				And questioned me in speech at last and said:﻿—



			 				“ ‘O son of Atreus! who of all the gods

				 				Hath taught thee how to take me in this snare,

				 				Unwilling as I am? What wouldst thou have?’



			 				“He spake; I answered: ‘Aged prophet, well

				 				Thou knowest. Why deceitfully inquire?

				 				It is that I am held a prisoner long

				 				Within this isle, and vainly seek the means

				 				Of my escape, and grief consumes my heart.

				 				Now﻿—since the gods know all things﻿—tell me this,

				 				What deity it is, that, hindering thus

				 				My voyage, keeps me here, and tell me how

				 				To cross the fishy deep and reach my home.’



			 				“Such were my words, and he in answer said:﻿—

				 				‘But thou to Jove and to the other gods

				 				Shouldst first have paid acceptable sacrifice,

				 				And shouldst have then embarked to reach with speed

				 				Thy native land across the dark-blue deep.

				 				Now it is not thy fate to see again

				 				Thy friends, thy stately palace, and the land

				 				That saw thy birth, until thou stand once more

				 				Beside the river that through Egypt flows

				 				From Jove, and offer sacred hecatombs

				 				To the ever-living gods inhabiting

				 				The boundless heaven, and they will speed thee forth

				 				Upon the voyage thou dost long to make.’



			 				“He spake. My heart was broken as I heard

				 				His bidding to recross the shadowy sea

				 				To Egypt, for the way was difficult

				 				And long; and yet I answered him and said:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Duly will I perform, O aged seer,

				 				What thou commandest. But I pray thee tell,

				 				And truly, whether all the sons of Greece

				 				Whom Nestor and myself, in setting sail,

				 				Left on the Trojan coast, have since returned

				 				Safe with their galleys, or have any died

				 				Untimely in their ships or in the arms

				 				Of their companions since the war was closed?’



			 				“I spake; again he answered me and said:﻿—

				 				‘Why dost thou ask, Atrides, since to know

				 				Thou needest not, nor is it well to explore

				 				The secrets of my mind? Thou canst not, sure,

				 				Refrain from tears when thou shalt know the whole.

				 				Many are dead, and many left in Troy.

				 				Two leaders only of the well-armed Greeks

				 				Were slain returning; in that combat thou

				 				Didst bear a part; one, living yet, is kept,

				 				Far in the mighty main, from his return.



			 				“ ‘Amid his well-oared galleys Ajax died.

				 				For Neptune first had driven him on the rocks

				 				Of Gyrae, yet had saved him from the sea;

				 				And he, though Pallas hated him, had yet

				 				Been rescued, but for uttering boastful words,

				 				Which drew his fate upon him. He had said

				 				That he, in spite of all the gods, would come

				 				Safe from those mountain waves. When Neptune heard

				 				The boaster’s challenge, instantly he laid

				 				His strong hand on the trident, smote the rock

				 				And cleft it to the base. Part stood erect,

				 				Part fell into the deep. There Ajax sat,

				 				And felt the shock, and with the falling mass

				 				Was carried headlong to the billowy depths

				 				Below, and drank the brine and perished there.

				 				Thy brother in his roomy ships escaped

				 				The danger, for imperial Juno’s aid

				 				Preserved him. But when near Meleia’s heights

				 				About to land, a tempest seized and swept

				 				The hero thence across the fishy deep,

				 				Lamenting his hard lot, to that far cape

				 				Where once abode Thyestes, and where now

				 				His son Aegisthus dwelt. But when the gods

				 				Sent other winds, and safe at last appeared

				 				The voyage, they returned, and reached their home.

				 				With joy he stepped upon his native soil,

				 				And kissed the earth that bore him, while his tears

				 				At that most welcome sight flowed fast and warm.

				 				Him from a lofty perch a spy beheld,

				 				Whom treacherous Aegisthus planted there,

				 				Bribed by two golden talents. He had watched

				 				The whole year through, lest, coming unobserved,

				 				The king might make his prowess felt. The spy

				 				Flew to the royal palace with the news,

				 				And instantly Aegisthus planned a snare.

				 				He chose among the people twenty men,

				 				The bravest, whom he stationed out of sight,

				 				And gave command that others should prepare

				 				A banquet. Then with chariots and with steeds,

				 				And with a deadly purpose in his heart,

				 				He went, and, meeting Agamemnon, bade

				 				The shepherd of the people to the feast,

				 				And slew him at the board as men might slay

				 				A bullock at the crib. Of all who went

				 				With Agamemnon thither, none survived,

				 				And of the followers of Aegisthus none,

				 				But all were slaughtered in the banquet-hall’



			 				“He spake; my heart was breaking, and I wept,

				 				While sitting on the sand, nor in my heart

				 				Cared I to live, or longer to behold

				 				The sweet light of the sun. But when there came

				 				Respite from tears and writhing on the ground,

				 				The Ancient of the Deep, who ne’er deceives,

				 				Spake yet again: ‘Atrides, lose no time

				 				In tears; they profit nothing. Rather seek

				 				The means by which thou mayst the soonest reach

				 				Thy native land. There thou perchance mayst find

				 				Aegisthus yet alive, or haply first

				 				Orestes may have slain him, and thyself

				 				Arrive to see the funeral rites performed.’



			 				“He spake, and though afflicted still, my heart

				 				Was somewhat comforted; my spirit rose,

				 				And thus I answered him with winged words:﻿—



			 				“ ‘These men I know; name now the third, who still

				 				Is kept from his return afar within

				 				The mighty main﻿—alive, perchance, or dead;

				 				For, though I dread to hear, I long to know.’



			 				“I spake, and Proteus answered me again:﻿—

				 				‘It is Laertes’ son, whose dwelling stands

				 				In Ithaca. I saw him in an isle,

				 				And in the cavern-palace of the nymph

				 				Calypso, weeping bitterly, for she

				 				Constrains his stay. He cannot leave the isle

				 				For his own country; ship arrayed with oars

				 				And seamen has he none to bear him o’er

				 				The breast of the great ocean. But for thee,

				 				’Tis not decreed that thou shalt meet thy fate

				 				And die, most noble Menelaus, where

				 				The steeds of Argos in her pastures graze.

				 				The gods will send thee to the Elysian plain,

				 				And to the end of earth, the dwelling-place

				 				Of fair-haired Rhadamanthus. There do men

				 				Lead easiest lives. No snow, no bitter cold,

				 				No beating rains, are there; the ocean-deeps

				 				With murmuring breezes from the West refresh

				 				The dwellers. Thither shalt thou go; for thou

				 				Art Helen’s spouse, and son-in-law of Jove.’



			 				“He spake, and plunged into the billowy deep.

				 				I to the fleet returned in company

				 				With my brave men, revolving, as I went,

				 				A thousand projects in my thought. I reached

				 				My galley by the sea, and we prepared

				 				Our evening meal. The hallowed night came down,

				 				And there upon the ocean-beach we slept.

				 				But when the rosy-fingered Morn appeared,

				 				The daughter of the Dawn, we drew our ships

				 				To the great deep, and raised the masts and spread

				 				The sails; the crews, all entering, took their seats

				 				Upon the benches, ranged in order due,

				 				And beat the foaming water with their oars.

				 				Again to Egypt’s coast I brought the fleet,

				 				And to the river that descends from Jove,

				 				And there I offered chosen hecatombs;

				 				And having thus appeased the gods, I reared

				 				A tomb to Agamemnon, that his fame

				 				Might never die. When this was done I sailed

				 				For home; the gods bestowed a favoring wind.

				 				But now remain thou till the eleventh day,

				 				Or till the twelfth, beneath my roof, and then

				 				Will I dismiss thee with munificent gifts﻿—

				 				Three steeds, a polished chariot, and a cup

				 				Of price, with which to pour, from day to day,

				 				Wine to the gods in memory of me.”



			 				Then spake discreet Telemachus again:﻿—

				 				“Atrides, seek not to detain me long,

				 				Though I could sit contentedly a year

				 				Beside thee, never longing for my home,

				 				Nor for my parents, such delight I find

				 				In listening to thy words; but even now,

				 				In hallowed Pylos, my companions grow

				 				Weary, while thou delayest my return.

				 				The gifts﻿—whate’er thou choosest to bestow﻿—

				 				Let them be such as I can treasure up.

				 				The steeds to Ithaca I may not take,

				 				I leave them to adorn thy retinue;

				 				For thou art ruler o’er a realm of plains,

				 				Where grows much lotus, and sweet grasses spring,

				 				And wheat and rye, and the luxuriant stalks

				 				Of the white barley. But in Ithaca

				 				Are no broad grounds for coursing, meadows none.

				 				Goats graze amid its fields, a fairer land

				 				Than those where horses feed. No isle that lies

				 				Within the deep has either roads for steeds

				 				Or meadows, least of all has Ithaca.”



			 				He spake; the valiant Menelaus smiled,

				 				And kindly touched him with his hand and said:﻿—



			 				“Dear son, thou comest of a generous stock;

				 				Thy words declare it. I will change my gifts,

				 				As well I may. Of all that in my house

				 				Are treasured up, the choicest I will give,

				 				And the most precious. I will give a cup

				 				Wrought all of silver save its brim of gold.

				 				It is the work of Vulcan. Phaedimus

				 				The hero, King of Sidon, gave it me,

				 				When I was coming home, and underneath

				 				His roof was sheltered. Now it shall be thine.”



			 				So talked they with each other. Meantime came

				 				Those who prepared the banquet to the halls

				 				Of the great monarch. Bringing sheep they came

				 				And strengthening wine. Their wives, who on their brows

				 				Wore showy fillets, brought the bread, and thus

				 				Within the house of Menelaus all

				 				Was bustle, setting forth the evening meal.



			 				But in the well-paved court which lay before

				 				The palace of Ulysses, where of late

				 				Their insolence was shown, the suitor train

				 				Amused themselves with casting quoits and spears,

				 				While by themselves Antinoüs, and the youth

				 				Of godlike mien, Eurymachus, who both

				 				Were eminent above the others, sat.

				 				To them Noëmon, son of Phronius, went,

				 				Drew near, bespake Antinoüs and inquired:﻿—



			 				“Is it among us known, or is it not,

				 				Antinoüs, when Telemachus returns

				 				From sandy Pylos? Thither he is gone

				 				And in my galley, which I need to cross

				 				To spacious Elis. There I have twelve mares

				 				And hardy mule-colts with them yet untamed,

				 				And some I must subdue to take the yoke.”



			 				He spake, and they were both amazed; for they

				 				Had never thought of him as visiting

				 				Neleian Pylos, deeming that the youth

				 				Was somewhere in his fields, among the flocks,

				 				Or haply with the keeper of the swine.



			 				Then did Antinoüs, Eupeithes’ son,

				 				Make answer: “Tell me truly when he sailed,

				 				And what young men of Ithaca he chose

				 				To go with him. Were they his slaves, or hired

				 				To be his followers? Tell, for I would know

				 				The whole. Took he thy ship against thy will?

				 				Or didst thou yield it at his first request?”



			 				Noëmon, son of Phornius, thus replied:﻿—

				 				“Most willingly I gave it, for what else

				 				Would anyone have done when such a man

				 				Desired it in his need? It would have been

				 				Hard to deny it. For the band of youths

				 				Who followed him, they are the bravest here

				 				Of all our people; and I saw embark,

				 				As their commander, Mentor, or some god

				 				Like Mentor altogether. One thing moves

				 				My wonder. Only yesterday, at dawn,

				 				I met with Mentor here, whom I before

				 				Had seen embarking for the Pylian coast.”



			 				Noëmon spake, and to his father’s house

				 				Departed. Both were troubled at his words,

				 				And all the suitors took at once their seats,

				 				And ceased their pastimes. Then Antinoüs spake,

				 				Son of Eupeithes, greatly vexed; his heart

				 				Was darkened with blind rage; his eyes shot fire.



			 				“Strange doings these! a great and proud exploit

				 				Performed﻿—this voyage of Telemachus,

				 				Which we had called impossible! The boy,

				 				In spite of us, has had his will and gone,

				 				And carried off a ship, and for his crew

				 				Chosen the bravest of the people here.

				 				He yet will prove a pest. May Jupiter

				 				Crush him ere he can work us further harm!

				 				Now give me a swift barque and twenty men

				 				That I may lie in ambush and keep watch

				 				For his return within the straits between

				 				This isle and rugged Samos; then, I deem,

				 				He will have sought his father to his cost.”



			 				He spake; they praised his words and bade him act,

				 				And rose and left their places, entering

				 				The palace of Ulysses. Brief the time

				 				That passed before Penelope was warned

				 				Of what the suitors treacherously planned.

				 				The herald Medon told her all. He heard

				 				In the outer court their counsels while within

				 				They plotted, and he hastened through the house

				 				To bring the tidings to Penelope.

				 				Penelope perceived him as he stepped

				 				Across the threshold, and bespake him thus:﻿—



			 				“Why, herald, have the suitor princes sent

				 				Thee hither? comest thou to bid the maids

				 				Of great Ulysses leave their tasks and make

				 				A banquet ready? Would their wooing here

				 				And elsewhere were but ended, and this feast

				 				Were their last feast on earth! Ye who in throngs

				 				Come hither and so wastefully consume

				 				The substance of the brave Telemachus,

				 				Have ye not from your parents, while ye yet

				 				Were children, heard how once Ulysses lived

				 				Among them, never wronging any man

				 				In all the realm by aught he did or said﻿—

				 				As mighty princes often do, through hate

				 				Of some and love of others? Never man

				 				Endured injustice at his hands, but you﻿—

				 				Your vile designs and acts are known; ye bear

				 				No grateful memory of a good man’s deeds.”



			 				And then, in turn, experienced Medon spake:﻿—

				 				“O queen, I would this evil were the worst!

				 				The suitors meditate a greater still,

				 				And a more heinous far. May Jupiter

				 				Never permit the crime! Their purpose is

				 				To meet Telemachus, on his return,

				 				And slay him with the sword; for thou must know

				 				That on a voyage to the Pylian coast

				 				And noble Lacedaemon he has sailed,

				 				To gather tidings of his father’s fate.”



			 				He spake, and her knees failed her and her heart

				 				Sank as she heard. Long time she could not speak;

				 				Her eyes were filled with tears, and her clear voice

				 				Was choked; yet, finding words at length, she said:﻿—



			 				“O herald! wherefore should my son have gone?

				 				There was no need that he should trust himself

				 				To the swift ships, those horses of the sea,

				 				With which men traverse its unmeasured waste.

				 				Was it that he might leave no name on earth?”



			 				And then again experienced Medon spake:﻿—

				 				“I know not whether prompted by some god

				 				Or moved by his own heart thy son has sailed

				 				For Pylos, hoping there to hear some news

				 				Of his returning father, or his fate.”



			 				Thus having said, the herald, traversing

				 				The palace of Ulysses, went his way,

				 				While a keen anguish overpowered the queen,

				 				Nor could she longer bear to keep her place

				 				Upon her seat﻿—and many seats were there﻿—

				 				But on the threshold of her gorgeous rooms

				 				Lay piteously lamenting. Round her came

				 				Her maidens wailing﻿—all, both old and young,

				 				Who formed her household. These Penelope,

				 				Sobbing in her great sorrow, thus bespake:﻿—



			 				“Hear me, my friends, the heavens have cast on me

				 				Griefs heavier than on any others born

				 				And reared with me﻿—me, who had lost by death

				 				Already a most gracious husband, one

				 				Who bore a lion heart and who was graced

				 				With every virtue, greatly eminent

				 				Among the Greeks, and widely famed abroad

				 				Through Hellas and all Argos. Now my son,

				 				He whom I loved, is driven before the storms

				 				From home, inglorious, and I was not told

				 				Of his departure. Ye too, worthless crew!

				 				Ye took no thought, not one of you, to call

				 				Me from my sleep, although ye must have known

				 				Full well when he embarked in his black ship.

				 				And if it had been told me that he planned

				 				This voyage, then, impatient as he was

				 				To sail, he would have certainly remained,

				 				Or else have left me in these halls a corpse.

				 				And now let one of my attendants call

				 				The aged Dolius, whom, when first I came

				 				To this abode, my father gave to me

				 				To be my servant, and who has in charge

				 				My orchards. Let him haste and take his place

				 				Beside Laertes, and to him declare

				 				All that has happened, that he may devise

				 				Some fitting remedy, or go among

				 				The people, to deplore the dark designs

				 				Of those who now are plotting to destroy

				 				The heir of great Ulysses and his own.”



			 				Then Eurycleia, the beloved nurse,

				 				Answered: “Dear lady, slay me with the sword,

				 				Or leave me here alive; I will conceal

				 				Nothing that has been done or said. I gave

				 				All that he asked, both bread and delicate wine,

				 				And took a solemn oath, which he required,

				 				To tell thee naught of this till twelve days passed,

				 				Or till thou shouldst thyself inquire and hear

				 				Of his departure, that those lovely cheeks

				 				Might not be stained with tears. Now bathe and put

				 				Fresh garments on, and to the upper rooms

				 				Ascending, with thy handmaids offer prayer

				 				To Pallas, daughter of the god who bears

				 				The aegis. She will then protect thy son,

				 				Even from death. Grieve not the aged man,

				 				Already much afflicted. Sure I am

				 				The lineage of Arcesius has not lost

				 				The favor of the gods, but someone yet

				 				Surviving will possess its lofty halls

				 				And its rich acres, stretching far away.”



			 				She spake; the queen repressed her grief, and held

				 				Her eyes from tears. She took the bath and put

				 				Fresh garments on, and, to the upper rooms

				 				Ascending with her maidens, heaped with cakes

				 				A canister, and prayed to Pallas thus:﻿—



			 				“Daughter invincible of Jupiter

				 				The Aegis-bearer, hear me. If within

				 				Thy courts the wise Ulysses ever burned

				 				Fat thighs of beeves or sheep, remember it,

				 				And rescue my dear son, and bring to naught

				 				The wicked plots of the proud suitor-crew.”



			 				She spake, and wept aloud. The goddess heard

				 				Her prayer. Meantime the suitors filled with noise

				 				The shadowy palace-halls, and there were some

				 				Among that throng of arrogant youths who said:﻿—



			 				“Truly the queen, whom we have wooed so long,

				 				Prepares for marriage; little does she know

				 				The bloody death we destine for her son.”



			 				So spake they, unaware of what was done

				 				Elsewhere. Antinoüs then stood forth and said:﻿—



			 				“Good friends, I warn you all that ye refrain

				 				From boasts like these, lest someone should report

				 				Your words within. Now let us silently

				 				Rise up, and all conspire to put in act

				 				The counsel all so heartily approve.”



			 				He spake, and chose a crew of twenty men,

				 				The bravest. To the seaside and the ship

				 				They went, and down to the deep water drew

				 				The ship, and put the mast and sails on board,

				 				And fitted duly to their leathern rings

				 				The oars, and spread the white sail overhead.

				 				Their nimble-handed servants brought them arms,

				 				And there they moored the galley, went on board,

				 				And supped and waited for the evening star.



			 				Now in the upper chamber the chaste queen,

				 				Penelope, lay fasting; food or wine

				 				She had not tasted, and her thoughts were still

				 				Fixed on her blameless son. Would he escape

				 				The threatened death, or perish by the hands

				 				Of the insolent suitors? As a lion’s thoughts,

				 				When, midst a crowd of men, he sees with dread

				 				The hostile circle slowly closing round,

				 				Such were her thoughts, when balmy sleep at length

				 				Came creeping over her as on her couch

				 				She lay reclined, her limbs relaxed in rest.



			 				Now Pallas framed a new device; she called

				 				A phantom up, in aspect like the dame

				 				Iphthime, whom Eumelus had espoused

				 				In Pherae, daughter of the high-souled chief

				 				Icarius. Her she sent into the halls

				 				Of great Ulysses, that she might beguile

				 				The sorrowful Penelope from tears

				 				And lamentations. By the thong that held

				 				The bolt she slid into the royal bower

				 				And standing by her head bespake the queen:﻿—



			 				“Penelope, afflicted as thou art,

				 				Art thou asleep? The ever-blessed gods

				 				Permit thee not to grieve and weep; thy son,

				 				Who has not sinned against them, shall return.”



			 				And then discreet Penelope replied,

				 				Still sweetly slumbering at the Gate of Dreams:﻿—



			 				“Why, sister, art thou here, who ne’er before

				 				Hast come to me? The home is far away

				 				In which thou dwellest. Thou exhortest me

				 				To cease from grieving, and to lay aside

				 				The painful thoughts that crowd into my mind,

				 				And torture me who have already lost

				 				A noble-minded, lionhearted spouse,

				 				One eminent among Achaia’s sons

				 				For every virtue, and whose fame was spread

				 				Through Hellas and through Argos. Now my son,

				 				My best beloved, goes to sea﻿—a boy,

				 				Unused to hardships, and unskilled to deal

				 				With strangers. More I sorrow for his sake

				 				Than for his father’s. I am filled with fear,

				 				And tremble lest he suffer wrong from those

				 				Among whom he has gone, or on the deep,

				 				Where he has enemies who lie in wait

				 				To slay him ere he reach his home again.”



			 				And then the shadowy image spake again:﻿—

				 				“Be of good courage; let not fear o’ercome

				 				Thy spirit, for there goes with him a guide

				 				Such as all others would desire to have

				 				Beside them ever, trusting in her power﻿—

				 				Pallas Athene, and she looks on thee

				 				With pity. From her presence I am sent,

				 				Her messenger, declaring this to thee.”



			 				Again discreet Penelope replied:﻿—

				 				“If then thou be a goddess and hast heard

				 				A goddess speak these words, declare, I pray,

				 				Of that ill-fated one, if yet he live

				 				And look upon the sun, or else have died

				 				And passed to the abodes beneath the earth.”



			 				Once more the shadowy image spake: “Of him

				 				Will I say nothing, whether living yet

				 				Or dead; no time is this for idle words.”



			 				She said, and from the chamber glided forth

				 				Beside the bolt, and mingled with the winds.

				 				Then quickly from her couch of sleep arose

				 				The daughter of Icarius, for her heart

				 				Was glad, so plainly had the dream conveyed

				 				Its message in the stillness of the night.



			 				Meanwhile the suitors on their ocean-path

				 				Went in their galley, plotting cruelly

				 				To slay Telemachus. A rocky isle

				 				Far in the middle sea, between the coast

				 				Of Ithaca and craggy Samos, lies,

				 				Named Asteris; of narrow bounds, yet there

				 				A sheltered haven is to which two straits

				 				Give entrance. There the Achaians lay in wait.





						Book 						V


					Departure of Ulysses from Calypso


				 				Mercury despatched by Jupiter to Calypso with a message commanding her to send away Ulysses﻿—A raft constructed by Ulysses﻿—His departure on the raft﻿—A storm raised by Neptune, and the raft destroyed﻿—Escape of Ulysses from the tempest, and his landing on the isle of Scheria, inhabited by the Phaeacians.





				Aurora, rising from her couch beside

				 				The famed Tithonus, brought the light of day

				 				To men and to immortals. Then the gods

				 				Came to their seats in council. With them came

				 				High-thundering Jupiter, amongst them all

				 				The mightiest. Pallas, mindful of the past,

				 				Spake of Ulysses and his many woes,

				 				Grieved that he still was with the island nymph:﻿—

				 				“O father Jove, and all ye blessed ones

				 				Who live forever! let not sceptred king

				 				Henceforth be gracious, mild, and merciful

				 				And righteous; rather be he deaf to prayer

				 				And prone to deeds of wrong, since no one now

				 				Remembers the divine Ulysses more

				 				Among the people over whom he ruled

				 				Benignly, like a father. Still he lies,

				 				Weighed down by many sorrows, in the isle

				 				And dwelling of Calypso, who so long

				 				Constrains his stay. To his dear native land

				 				Depart he cannot; ship arrayed with oars

				 				And seamen has he none, to bear him o’er

				 				The breast of the broad ocean. Nay, even now,

				 				Against his well-beloved son a plot

				 				is laid, to slay him as he journeys home

				 				From Pylos the divine, and from the walls

				 				Of famous Sparta, whither he had gone

				 				To gather tidings of his father’s fate.”



			 				Then answered her the Ruler of the storms:﻿—

				 				“My child, what words are these that pass thy lips?

				 				Was not thy long-determined counsel this﻿—

				 				That in good time Ulysses should return,

				 				To be avenged? Guide, then, Telemachus

				 				Wisely﻿—for so thou canst﻿—that, all unharmed,

				 				He reach his native land, and, in their barques,

				 				Homeward the suitor-train retrace their way.”



			 				He spake, and turned to Hermes, his dear son:﻿—

				 				“Hermes﻿—for thou in this my messenger

				 				Art, as in all things﻿—to the bright-haired nymph

				 				Make known my steadfast purpose﻿—the return

				 				Of suffering Ulysses. Neither gods

				 				Nor men shall guide his voyage. On a raft,

				 				Made firm with bands, he shall depart and reach,

				 				After long hardships, on the twentieth day,

				 				The fertile shore of Scheria, on whose isle

				 				Dwell the Phaeacians, kinsmen of the gods.

				 				They like a god shall honor him, and thence

				 				Send him to his loved country in a ship,

				 				With ample gifts of brass and gold, and store

				 				Of raiment﻿—wealth like which he ne’er had brought

				 				From conquered Ilion, had he reached his home

				 				Safely, with all his portion of the spoil.

				 				So is it preordained that he behold

				 				His friends again, and stand once more within

				 				His high-roofed palace, on his native soil.”



			 				He spake; the herald Argicide obeyed,

				 				And hastily beneath his feet he bound

				 				The fair, ambrosial golden sandals, worn

				 				To bear him over ocean like the wind,

				 				And o’er the boundless land. His wand he took,

				 				Wherewith he softly seals the eyes of men,

				 				And opens them at will from sleep. With this

				 				In hand, the mighty Argus-queller flew,

				 				And, lighting on Pieria, from the sky

				 				Plunged downward to the deep, and skimmed its face

				 				Like hovering seamew, that on the broad gulfs

				 				Of the unfruitful ocean seeks her prey,

				 				And often dips her pinions in the brine;

				 				So Hermes flew along the waste of waves.



			 				But when he reached that island, far away,

				 				Forth from the dark-blue ocean-swell he stepped

				 				Upon the sea-beach, walking till he came

				 				To the vast cave in which the bright-haired nymph

				 				Made her abode. He found the nymph within;

				 				A fire blazed brightly on the hearth, and far

				 				Was wafted o’er the isle the fragrant smoke

				 				Of cloven cedar, burning in the flame.

				 				And cypress-wood. Meanwhile, in her recess,

				 				She sweetly sang, as busily she threw

				 				The golden shuttle through the web she wove.

				 				And all about the grotto alders grew,

				 				And poplars, and sweet-smelling cypresses.

				 				In a green forest, high among whose boughs

				 				Birds of broad wing, wood-owls, and falcons built

				 				Their nests, and crows, with voices sounding far,

				 				All haunting for their food the ocean-side.

				 				A vine, with downy leaves and clustering grapes,

				 				Crept over all the cavern rock. Four springs

				 				Poured forth their glittering waters in a row,

				 				And here and there went wandering side by side.

				 				Around were meadows of soft green, o’ergrown

				 				With violets and parsley. ’Twas a spot

				 				Where even an immortal might awhile

				 				Linger, and gaze with wonder and delight.

				 				The herald Argus-queller stood, and saw,

				 				And marvelled; but as soon as he had viewed

				 				The wonders of the place, he turned his steps,

				 				Entering the broad-roofed cave. Calypso there,

				 				The glorious goddess, saw him as he came,

				 				And knew him; for the ever-living gods

				 				Are to each other known, though one may dwell

				 				Far from the rest. Ulysses, large of heart,

				 				Was not within. Apart, upon the shore,

				 				He sat and sorrowed, where he oft in tears

				 				And sighs and vain repinings passed the hours,

				 				Gazing with wet eyes on the barren deep.

				 				Now, placing Hermes on a shining seat

				 				Of state, Calypso, glorious goddess, said:



			 				“Thou of the golden wand, revered and loved,

				 				What, Hermes, brings thee hither? Passing few

				 				Have been thy visits. Make thy pleasure known.

				 				My heart enjoins me to obey, if aught

				 				That thou commandest be within my power;

				 				But first accept the offerings due a guest.”



			 				The goddess, speaking thus, before him placed

				 				A table, where the heaped ambrosia lay,

				 				And mingled the red nectar. Ate and drank

				 				The herald Argus-queller, and, refreshed,

				 				Answered the nymph, and made his message known:﻿—



			 				“Art thou a goddess, and dost ask of me,

				 				A god, why came I hither? Yet, since thou

				 				Requirest, I will truly tell the cause.

				 				I came unwillingly, at Jove’s command;

				 				For who of choice would traverse the wide waste

				 				Of the salt ocean, with no city near

				 				Where men adore the gods with solemn rites

				 				And chosen hecatombs. No god has power

				 				To elude or to resist the purposes

				 				Of aegis-bearing Jove. With thee abides,

				 				He bids me say, the most unhappy man

				 				Of all who round the city of Priam waged

				 				The battle through nine years, and, in the tenth,

				 				Laying it waste, departed for their homes.

				 				But in their voyage they provoked the wrath

				 				Of Pallas, who called up the furious winds

				 				And angry waves against them. By his side

				 				Sank all his gallant comrades in the deep.

				 				Him did the winds and waves drive hither. Him

				 				Jove bids thee send away with speed; for here

				 				He must not perish, far from all he loves.

				 				So is it preordained that he behold

				 				His friends again, and stand once more within

				 				His high-roofed palace, on his native soil.”



			 				He spake; Calypso, glorious goddess, heard,

				 				And shuddered, and with winged words replied:﻿—



			 				“Ye are unjust, ye gods, and, envious far

				 				Beyond all other beings, cannot bear

				 				That ever goddess openly should make

				 				A mortal man her consort. Thus it was

				 				When once Aurora, rosy-fingered, took

				 				Orion for her husband; ye were stung,

				 				Amid your blissful lives, with envious hate,

				 				Till chaste Diana, of the golden throne,

				 				Smote him with silent arrows from her bow,

				 				And slew him in Ortygia. Thus, again,

				 				When bright-haired Ceres, swayed by her own heart,

				 				In fields which bore three yearly harvests, met

				 				Iäsion as a lover, this was known

				 				Erelong to Jupiter, who flung from high

				 				A flaming thunderbolt, and laid him dead.

				 				And now ye envy me, that with me dwells

				 				A mortal man. I saved him as he clung

				 				Alone upon his floating keel; for Jove

				 				Had cloven with a bolt of fire from heaven

				 				His galley in the midst of the black sea,

				 				And all his gallant comrades perished there.

				 				Him kindly I received; I cherished him,

				 				And promised him a life that ne’er should know

				 				Decay or death. But since no god has power

				 				To elude or to withstand the purposes

				 				Of aegis-bearing Jove, let him depart﻿—

				 				If so the sovereign moves him and commands﻿—

				 				Over the barren deep. I send him not;

				 				For neither ship arrayed with oars have I,

				 				Nor seamen, o’er the boundless waste of waves

				 				To bear him hence. My counsel I will give,

				 				And nothing will I hide that he should know,

				 				To place him safely on his native shore.”



			 				The herald Argus-queller answered her:﻿—

				 				“Dismiss him thus, and bear in mind the wrath

				 				Of Jove, lest it be kindled against thee.”



			 				Thus having said, the mighty Argicide

				 				Departed; and the nymph, who now had heard

				 				The doom of Jove, sought the greathearted man,

				 				Ulysses. Him she found beside the deep,

				 				Seated alone, with eyes from which the tears

				 				Were never dried; for now no more the nymph

				 				Delighted him; he wasted his sweet life

				 				In yearning for his home. Night after night

				 				He slept constrained within the hollow cave,

				 				The unwilling by the fond; and day by day

				 				He sat upon the rocks that edged the shore,

				 				And in continual weeping and in sighs

				 				And vain repinings wore the hours away,

				 				Gazing through tears upon the barren deep.

				 				The glorious goddess stood by him and spake:﻿—



			 				“Unhappy! sit no longer sorrowing here,

				 				Nor waste life thus. Lo! I most willingly

				 				Dismiss thee hence. Rise, hew down trees, and bind

				 				Their trunks with brazen clamps into a raft,

				 				And fasten planks above, a lofty floor,

				 				That it may bear thee o’er the dark-blue deep.

				 				Bread will I put on board, water, and wine﻿—

				 				Red wine, that cheers the heart﻿—and wrap thee well

				 				In garments, and send after thee the wind,

				 				That safely thou attain thy native shore,

				 				If so the gods permit thee, who abide

				 				In the broad heaven above, and better know

				 				By far than I, and far more wisely judge.”



			 				Ulysses, the great sufferer, as she spake

				 				Shuddered, and thus with winged words replied:﻿—



			 				“Some other purpose than to send me home

				 				Is in thy heart, O goddess, bidding me

				 				To cross this frightful sea upon a raft﻿—

				 				This perilous sea, where never even ships

				 				Pass with their rapid keels, though Jove bestow

				 				The wind that glads the seaman. Nay, I climb

				 				No raft, against thy wish, unless thou swear

				 				The great oath of the gods that thou in this

				 				Dost meditate no other harm to me.”



			 				He spake; Calypso, glorious goddess, smiled,

				 				And smoothed his forehead with her hand, and said:﻿—



			 				“Perverse, and slow to see where guile is not!

				 				How could thy heart permit thee thus to speak?

				 				Now bear me witness, Earth, and ye broad Heavens

				 				Above us, and ye waters of the Styx

				 				That flow beneath us, mightiest oath of all,

				 				And most revered by all the blessed gods,

				 				That I design no other harm to thee,

				 				But that I plan for thee, and counsel thee

				 				What I would do were I in need like thine.

				 				I bear a juster mind; my bosom holds

				 				A pitying heart, and not a heart of steel.”



			 				Thus having said, the glorious goddess moved

				 				Away with hasty steps, and where she trod

				 				He followed, till they reached the vaulted cave﻿—

				 				The goddess and the hero. There he took

				 				The seat whence Hermes had just risen. The nymph

				 				Brought forth whatever mortals eat and drink

				 				To set before him. She right opposite

				 				To that of great Ulysses took her seat.

				 				Ambrosia there her maidens laid, and there

				 				Poured nectar. Both put forth their hands, and took

				 				The ready viands, till at length the calls

				 				Of hunger and of thirst were satisfied;

				 				Calypso, glorious goddess, then began:﻿—



			 				“Son of Laertes, man of many wiles,

				 				Highborn Ulysses! thus wilt thou depart

				 				Home to thy native country? Then farewell;

				 				But, couldst thou know the sufferings Fate ordains

				 				For thee ere yet thou landest on its shore,

				 				Thou wouldst remain to keep this home with me

				 				And be immortal, strong as is thy wish

				 				To see thy wife﻿—a wish that day by day

				 				Possesses thee. I cannot deem myself

				 				In face or form less beautiful than she;

				 				For never with immortals can the race

				 				Of mortal dames in form or face compare.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered her:﻿—



			 				“Bear with me, gracious goddess; well I know

				 				All thou couldst say. The sage Penelope

				 				In feature and in stature comes not nigh

				 				To thee, for she is mortal﻿—deathless thou,

				 				And ever young; yet day by day I long

				 				To be at home once more, and pine to see

				 				The hour of my return. Even though some god

				 				Smite me on the black ocean, I shall bear

				 				The stroke, for in my bosom dwells a mind

				 				Patient of suffering; much have I endured,

				 				And much survived, in tempests on the deep,

				 				And in the battle; let this happen too.”



			 				He spake; the sun went down; the night came on;

				 				And now the twain withdrew to a recess

				 				Deep in the vaulted cave, where, side by side,

				 				They took their rest. But when the child of Dawn,

				 				Aurora, rosy-fingered, looked abroad,

				 				Ulysses put his vest and mantle on;

				 				The nymph too, in a robe of silver-white,

				 				Ample, and delicate, and beautiful,

				 				Arrayed herself, and round about her loins

				 				Wound a fair golden girdle, drew a veil

				 				Over her head, and planned to send away

				 				Magnanimous Ulysses. She bestowed

				 				A heavy axe, of steel and double-edged,

				 				Well fitted to the hand, the handle wrought

				 				Of olive-wood, firm set and beautiful.

				 				A polished adze she gave him next, and led

				 				The way to a far corner of the isle,

				 				Where lofty trees, alders and poplars, stood,

				 				And firs that reached the clouds, sapless and dry

				 				Long since, and fitter thus to ride the waves.

				 				Then, having shown where grew the tallest trees,

				 				Calypso, glorious goddess, sought her home.



			 				Trees then he felled, and soon the task was done.

				 				Twenty in all he brought to earth, and squared

				 				Their trunks with the sharp steel, and carefully

				 				He smoothed their sides, and wrought them by a line.

				 				Calypso, gracious goddess, having brought

				 				Wimbles, he bored the beams, and, fitting them

				 				Together, made them fast with nails and clamps.

				 				As when some builder, skilful in his art,

				 				Frames for a ship of burden the broad keel,

				 				Such ample breadth Ulysses gave the raft.

				 				Upon the massy beams he reared a deck,

				 				And floored it with long planks from end to end.

				 				On this a mast he raised, and to the mast

				 				Fitted a yard; he shaped a rudder next,

				 				To guide the raft along her course, and round

				 				With woven work of willow-boughs he fenced

				 				Her sides against the dashings of the sea.

				 				Calypso, gracious goddess, brought him store

				 				Of canvas, which he fitly shaped to sails,

				 				And, rigging her with cords and ropes and stays,

				 				Heaved her with levers into the great deep.



			 				’Twas the fourth day. His labors now were done,

				 				And on the fifth the goddess from her isle

				 				Dismissed him, newly from the bath, arrayed

				 				In garments given by her, that shed perfumes.

				 				A skin of dark red wine she put on board,

				 				A larger one of water, and for food

				 				A basket, stored with viands such as please

				 				The appetite. A friendly wind and soft

				 				She sent before. The great Ulysses spread

				 				His canvas joyfully to catch the breeze,

				 				And sat and guided with nice care the helm,

				 				Gazing with fixed eye on the Pleiades,

				 				Boötes setting late, and the Great Bear,

				 				By others called the Wain, which, wheeling round,

				 				Looks ever toward Orion, and alone

				 				Dips not into the waters of the deep.

				 				For so Calypso, glorious goddess, bade

				 				That on his ocean journey he should keep

				 				That constellation ever on his left.

				 				Now seventeen days were in the voyage past,

				 				And on the eighteenth shadowy heights appeared,

				 				The nearest point of the Phaeacian land,

				 				Lying on the dark ocean like a shield.



			 				But mighty Neptune, coming from among

				 				The Ethiopians, saw him. Far away

				 				He saw, from mountain-heights of Solyma,

				 				The voyager, and burned with fiercer wrath,

				 				And shook his head, and said within himself:﻿—



			 				“Strange! now I see the gods have new designs

				 				For this Ulysses, formed while I was yet

				 				In Ethiopia. He draws near the land

				 				Of the Phaeacians, where it is decreed

				 				He shall o’erpass the boundary of his woes;

				 				But first, I think, he will have much to bear.”



			 				He spake, and round about him called the clouds

				 				And roused the ocean﻿—wielding in his hand

				 				The trident﻿—summoned all the hurricanes

				 				Of all the winds, and covered earth and sky

				 				At once with mists, while from above the night

				 				Fell suddenly. The east wind and the south

				 				Pushed forth at once, with the strong-blowing west,

				 				And the clear north rolled up his mighty waves.

				 				Ulysses trembled in his knees and heart,

				 				And thus to his great soul, lamenting, said:﻿—



			 				“What will become of me? unhappy man!

				 				I fear that all the goddess said was true,

				 				Foretelling what disasters should o’ertake

				 				My voyage ere I reach my native land.

				 				Now are her words fulfilled. How Jupiter

				 				Wraps the great heaven in clouds and stirs the deep

				 				To tumult! Wilder grow the hurricanes

				 				Of all the winds, and now my fate is sure.

				 				Thrice happy, four times happy, they who fell

				 				On Troy’s wide field, warring for Atreus’ sons:

				 				O, had I met my fate and perished there,

				 				That very day on which the Trojan host,

				 				Around the dead Achilles, hurled at me

				 				Their brazen javelins, I had then received

				 				Due burial, and great glory with the Greeks;

				 				Now must I die a miserable death.”



			 				As thus he spake, upon him, from on high,

				 				A huge and frightful billow broke; it whirled

				 				The raft around, and far from it he fell.

				 				His hands let go the rudder; a fierce rush

				 				Of all the winds together snapped in twain

				 				The mast; far off the yard and canvas flew

				 				Into the deep; the billow held him long

				 				Beneath the waters, and he strove in vain

				 				Quickly to rise to air from that huge swell

				 				Of ocean, for the garments weighed him down

				 				Which fair Calypso gave him. But at length

				 				Emerging, he rejected from his throat

				 				The bitter brine that down his forehead streamed.

				 				Even then, though hopeless with dismay, his thought

				 				Was on the raft; and, struggling through the waves,

				 				He seized it, sprang on board, and, seated there,

				 				Escaped the threatened death. Still to and fro

				 				The rolling billows drave it. As the wind

				 				In autumn sweeps the thistles o’er the field,

				 				Clinging together, so the blasts of heaven

				 				Hither and thither drove it o’er the sea.

				 				And now the south wind flung it to the north

				 				To buffet; now the east wind to the west.



			 				Ino Leucothea saw him clinging there﻿—

				 				The delicate-footed child of Cadmus, once

				 				A mortal, speaking with a mortal voice,

				 				Though now within the ocean gulfs she shares

				 				The honors of the gods. With pity she

				 				Beheld Ulysses struggling thus distressed,

				 				And, rising from the abyss below, in form

				 				A cormorant, the sea-nymph took her perch

				 				On the well-banded raft, and thus she said:﻿—



			 				“Ah, luckless man! how hast thou angered thus

				 				Earthshaking Neptune, that he visits thee

				 				With these disasters? Yet he cannot take,

				 				Although he seek it earnestly, thy life.

				 				Now do my bidding, for thou seemest wise.

				 				Laying aside thy garments, let the raft

				 				Drift with the winds, while thou, by strength of arm,

				 				Makest thy way in swimming to the land

				 				Of the Phaeacians, where thy safety lies.

				 				Receive this veil, and bind its heavenly woof

				 				Beneath thy breast, and have no further fear

				 				Of hardship or of danger. But, as soon

				 				As thou shalt touch the island, take it off,

				 				And turn away thy face, and fling it far

				 				From where thou standest into the black deep.”



			 				The goddess gave the veil as thus she spoke,

				 				And to the tossing deep went down, in form

				 				A cormorant; the black wave covered her.

				 				But still Ulysses, mighty sufferer,

				 				Pondered, and thus to his great soul he said:﻿—



			 				“Ah me! perhaps some god is planning here

				 				Some other fraud against me, bidding me

				 				Forsake my raft. I will not yet obey,

				 				For still far off I see the land in which

				 				’Tis said my refuge lies. This will I do,

				 				For this seems wisest. While the fastenings last

				 				That hold these timbers, I will keep my place

				 				And bide the tempest here; but when the waves

				 				Shall dash my raft in pieces, I will swim,

				 				For nothing better will remain to do.”



			 				As he revolved this purpose in his mind,

				 				Earthshaking Neptune sent a mighty wave,

				 				Horrid and huge and high, and where he sat

				 				It smote him. As a violent wind uplifts

				 				The dry chaff heaped upon a threshing-floor,

				 				And sends it scattered through the air abroad,

				 				So did that wave fling loose the ponderous beams.

				 				To one of these, Ulysses, clinging fast,

				 				Bestrode it, like a horseman on his steed;

				 				And now he took the garments off, bestowed

				 				By fair Calypso, binding round his breast

				 				The veil, and forward plunged into the deep,

				 				With palms outspread, prepared to swim. Meanwhile

				 				Neptune beheld him﻿—Neptune, mighty king﻿—

				 				And shook his head, and said within himself:﻿—



			 				“Go thus, and laden with mischances roam

				 				The waters till thou come among the race

				 				Cherished by Jupiter, but well I deem

				 				Thou wilt not find thy share of suffering light.”



			 				Thus having said he urged his coursers on,

				 				With their fair-flowing manes, until he came

				 				To Aegae, where his glorious palace stands.



			 				But Pallas, child of Jove, had other thoughts.

				 				She stayed the course of every wind beside,

				 				And bade them rest, and lulled them into sleep,

				 				But summoned the swift north to break the waves,

				 				That so Ulysses, the highborn, escaped

				 				From death and from the fates, might be the guest

				 				Of the Phaeacians﻿—men who love the sea.

				 				Two days and nights among the mighty waves

				 				He floated, oft his heart foreboding death.

				 				But when the bright-haired Eos had fulfilled

				 				The third day’s course, and all the winds were laid,

				 				And calm was on the watery waste, he saw

				 				That land was near, as, lifted on the crest

				 				Of a huge swell, he looked with sharpened sight;

				 				And as a father’s life preserved makes glad

				 				His children’s hearts, when long time he has lain

				 				Sick, wrung with pain, and wasting by the power

				 				Of some malignant genius, till at length

				 				The gracious gods bestow a welcome cure,

				 				So welcome to Ulysses was the sight

				 				Of woods and fields. By swimming on he thought

				 				To climb and tread the shore; but when he drew

				 				So near that one who shouted could be heard

				 				From land, the sound of ocean on the rocks

				 				Came to his ear﻿—for there huge breakers roared

				 				And spouted fearfully, and all around

				 				Was covered with the sea-foam. Haven here

				 				Was none for ships, nor sheltering creek, but shores

				 				Beetling from high, and crags and walls of rock.

				 				Ulysses trembled both in knees and heart,

				 				And thus to his great soul, lamenting, said:﻿—



			 				“Now woe is me! as soon as Jove has shown

				 				What I had little hoped to see, the land,

				 				And I through all these waves have ploughed my way,

				 				I find no issue from the hoary deep.

				 				For sharp rocks border it, and all around

				 				Roar the wild surges; slippery cliffs arise

				 				Close to deep gulfs, and footing there is none

				 				Where I might plant my steps and thus escape.

				 				All effort now were fruitless to resist

				 				The mighty billow hurrying me away

				 				To dash me on the pointed rocks. If yet

				 				I strive, by swimming further, to descry

				 				Some sloping shore or harbor of the isle,

				 				I fear the tempest, lest it hurl me back,

				 				Heavily groaning, to the fishy deep;

				 				Or huge sea-monster, from the multitude

				 				Which sovereign Amphitritè feeds, be sent

				 				Against me by some god﻿—for well I know

				 				The power who shakes the shores is wroth with me.”



			 				While he revolved these doubts within his mind,

				 				A huge wave hurled him toward the rugged coast.

				 				Then had his limbs been flayed, and all his bones

				 				Broken at once, had not the blue-eyed maid,

				 				Minerva, prompted him. Borne toward the rock,

				 				He clutched it instantly with both his hands,

				 				And panting clung till that huge wave rolled by,

				 				And so escaped its fury. Back it came,

				 				And smote him once again, and flung him far

				 				Seaward. As to the claws of Polypus,

				 				Plucked from its bed, the pebbles thickly cling,

				 				So flakes of skin, from off his powerful hands,

				 				Were left upon the rock. The mighty surge

				 				O’erwhelmed him; he had perished ere his time﻿—

				 				Hapless Ulysses!﻿—but the blue-eyed maid,

				 				Pallas, informed his mind with forecast. Straight

				 				Emerging from the wave that shoreward rolled,

				 				He swam along the coast and eyed it well,

				 				In hope of sloping beach or sheltered creek.

				 				But when, in swimming, he had reached the mouth

				 				Of a soft-flowing river, here appeared

				 				The spot he wished for, smooth, without a rock,

				 				And here was shelter from the wind. He felt

				 				The current’s flow, and thus devoutly prayed:﻿—



			 				“Hear me, O sovereign power, whoe’er thou art!

				 				To thee, the long-desired, I come. I seek

				 				Escape from Neptune’s threatenings on the sea.

				 				The deathless gods respect the prayer of him

				 				Who looks to them for help, a fugitive,

				 				As I am now, when to thy stream I come,

				 				And to thy knees, from many a hardship past.

				 				O thou that here art ruler, I declare

				 				Myself thy suppliant; be thou merciful.”



			 				He spoke: the river stayed his current, checked

				 				The billows, smoothed them to a calm, and gave

				 				The swimmer a safe landing at his mouth.

				 				Then dropped his knees and sinewy arms at once,

				 				Unstrung, for faint with struggling was his heart.

				 				His body was all swol’n; the brine gushed forth

				 				From mouth and nostrils; all unnerved he lay,

				 				Breathless and speechless; utter weariness

				 				O’ermastered him. But when he breathed again,

				 				And his flown senses had returned, he loosed

				 				The veil that Ino gave him from his breast,

				 				And to the salt flood cast it. A great wave

				 				Bore it far down the stream; the goddess there

				 				In her own hands received it. He, meanwhile,

				 				Withdrawing from the brink, lay down among

				 				The reeds, and kissed the harvest-bearing earth,

				 				And thus to his great soul, lamenting, said:﻿—



			 				“Ah me! what must I suffer more? what yet

				 				Will happen to me? If by the river’s side

				 				I pass the unfriendly watches of the night,

				 				The cruel cold and dews that steep the bank

				 				May, in this weakness, end me utterly,

				 				For chilly blows this river-air at dawn;

				 				But should I climb this hill, to sleep within

				 				The shadowy wood, among thick shrubs, if cold

				 				And weariness allow me, then I fear,

				 				That, while the pleasant slumbers o’er me steal,

				 				I may become the prey of savage beasts.”



			 				Yet, as he longer pondered, this seemed best.

				 				He rose, and sought the wood, and found it near

				 				The water, on a height, o’erlooking far

				 				The region round. Between two shrubs that sprang

				 				Both from one spot he entered﻿—olive-trees,

				 				One wild, one fruitful. The damp-blowing wind

				 				Ne’er pierced their covert; never blazing sun

				 				Darted his beams within, nor pelting shower

				 				Beat through, so closely intertwined they grew.

				 				Here entering, Ulysses heaped a bed

				 				Of leaves with his own hands; he made it broad

				 				And high, for thick the leaves had fallen around.

				 				Two men and three, in that abundant store,

				 				Might bide the winter storm, though keen the cold.

				 				Ulysses, the great sufferer, on his couch

				 				Looked and rejoiced, and placed himself within,

				 				And heaped the leaves high o’er him and around,

				 				As one who, dwelling in the distant fields,

				 				Without a neighbor near him, hides a brand

				 				In the dark ashes, keeping carefully

				 				The seeds of fire alive, lest he, perforce,

				 				To light his hearth must bring them from afar;

				 				So did Ulysses in that pile of leaves

				 				Bury himself, while Pallas o’er his eyes

				 				Poured sleep, and closed his lids, that he might take,

				 				After his painful toils, the fitting rest.





						Book 						VI


					Ulysses Discovered by Nausicaä


				 				Nausicaä, daughter of Alcinoüs, king of the Phaeacians, directed by Pallas to go to the river and wash her marriage robes﻿—Sports of her maidens after the washing is performed﻿—Ulysses awakened by the noise, relieved and clothed by Nausicaä, and bidden to follow her into the city, and there make his suit to the queen, the wife of Alcinoüs.





				Thus overcome with toil and weariness,

				 				The noble sufferer Ulysses slept,

				 				While Pallas hastened to the realm and town

				 				Peopled by the Phaeacians, who of yore

				 				Abode in spacious Hypereia, near

				 				The insolent race of Cyclops, and endured

				 				Wrong from their mightier hands. A godlike chief,

				 				Nausithoüs, led them, to a new abode,

				 				And planted them in Scheria, far away

				 				From plotting neighbors. With a wall he fenced

				 				Their city, built them dwellings there, and reared

				 				Fanes to the gods, and changed the plain to fields.

				 				But he had bowed to death, and had gone down

				 				To Hades, and Alcinoüs, whom the gods

				 				Endowed with wisdom, governed in his stead.

				 				Now to his palace, planning the return

				 				Of the magnanimous Ulysses, came

				 				The blue-eyed goddess Pallas, entering

				 				The gorgeous chamber where a damsel slept﻿—

				 				Nausicaä, daughter of the large-souled king

				 				Alcinoüs, beautiful in form and face

				 				As one of the immortals. Near her lay,

				 				And by the portal, one on either side,

				 				Fair as the Graces, two attendant maids.

				 				The shining doors were shut. But Pallas came

				 				As comes a breath of air, and stood beside

				 				The damsel’s head and spake. In look she seemed

				 				The daughter of the famous mariner

				 				Dymas, a maiden whom Nausicaä loved,

				 				The playmate of her girlhood. In her shape

				 				The blue-eyed goddess stood, and thus she said:﻿—



			 				“Nausicaä, has thy mother then brought forth

				 				A careless housewife? Thy magnificent robes

				 				Lie still neglected, though thy marriage day

				 				Is near, when thou art to array thyself

				 				In seemly garments, and bestow the like

				 				On those who lead thee to the bridal rite;

				 				For thus the praise of men is won, and thus

				 				Thy father and thy gracious mother both

				 				Will be rejoiced. Now with the early dawn

				 				Let us all hasten to the washing-place.

				 				I too would go with thee, and help thee there,

				 				That thou mayst sooner end the task, for thou

				 				Not long wilt be unwedded. Thou art wooed

				 				Already by the noblest of the race

				 				Of the Phaeacians, for thy birth, like theirs,

				 				Is of the noblest. Make thy suit at morn

				 				To thy illustrious father, that he bid

				 				His mules and car be harnessed to convey

				 				Thy girdles, robes, and mantles marvellous

				 				In beauty. That were seemlier than to walk,

				 				Since distant from the town the lavers lie.”



			 				Thus having said, the blue-eyed Pallas went

				 				Back to Olympus, where the gods have made,

				 				So saith tradition, their eternal seat.

				 				The tempest shakes it not, nor is it drenched

				 				By showers, and there the snow doth never fall.

				 				The calm clear ether is without a cloud;

				 				And in the golden light, that lies on all,

				 				Days after day the blessed gods rejoice.

				 				Thither the blue-eyed goddess, having given

				 				Her message to the sleeping maid, withdrew.



			 				Soon the bright morning came. Nausicaä rose,

				 				Clad royally, as marvelling at her dream

				 				She hastened through the palace to declare

				 				Her purpose to her father and the queen.

				 				She found them both within. Her mother sat

				 				Beside the hearth with her attendant maids,

				 				And turned the distaff loaded with a fleece

				 				Dyed in sea-purple. On the threshold stood

				 				Her father, going forth to meet the chiefs

				 				Of the Phaeacians in a council where

				 				Their noblest asked his presence. Then the maid,

				 				Approaching her beloved father, spake:﻿—



			 				“I pray, dear father, give command to make

				 				A chariot ready for me, with high sides

				 				And sturdy wheels, to bear to the river-brink,

				 				There to be cleansed, the costly robes that now

				 				Lie soiled. Thee likewise it doth well beseem

				 				At councils to appear in vestments fresh

				 				And stainless. Thou hast also in these halls

				 				Five sons, two wedded, three in boyhood’s bloom,

				 				And ever in the dance they need attire

				 				New from the wash. All this must I provide.”



			 				She ended, for she shrank from saying aught

				 				Of her own hopeful marriage. He perceived

				 				Her thought and said: “Mules I deny thee not,

				 				My daughter, nor aught else. Go then; my grooms

				 				Shall make a carriage ready with high sides

				 				And sturdy wheels, and a broad rack above.”



			 				He spake, and gave command. The grooms obeyed,

				 				And, making ready in the outer court

				 				The strong-wheeled chariot, led the harnessed mules

				 				Under the yoke and made them fast; and then

				 				Appeared the maiden, bringing from her bower

				 				The shining garments. In the polished car

				 				She piled them, while with many pleasant meats

				 				And flavoring morsels for the day’s repast

				 				Her mother filled a hamper, and poured wine

				 				Into a goatskin. As her daughter climbed

				 				The car, she gave into her hands a cruse

				 				Of gold with smooth anointing oil for her

				 				And her attendant maids. Nausicaä took

				 				The scourge and showy reins, and struck the mules

				 				To urge them onward. Onward with loud noise

				 				They went, and with a speed that slackened not,

				 				And bore the robes and her﻿—yet not alone,

				 				For with her went the maidens of her train.

				 				Now when they reached the river’s pleasant brink,

				 				Where lavers had been hollowed out to last

				 				Perpetually, and freely through them flowed

				 				Pure water that might cleanse the foulest stains,

				 				They loosed the mules, and drove them from the wain

				 				To browse the sweet grass by the eddying stream;

				 				And took the garments out, and flung them down

				 				In the dark water, and with hasty feet

				 				Trampled them there in frolic rivalry.

				 				And when the task was done, and all the stains

				 				Were cleansed away, they spread the garments out

				 				Along the beach and where the stream had washed

				 				The gravel cleanest. Then they bathed, and gave

				 				Their limbs the delicate oil, and took their meal

				 				Upon the river’s border﻿—while the robes

				 				Beneath the sun’s warm rays were growing dry.

				 				And now, when they were all refreshed by food,

				 				Mistress and maidens laid their veils aside

				 				And played at ball. Nausicaä the white-armed

				 				Began a song. As when the archer-queen

				 				Diana, going forth among the hills﻿—

				 				The sides of high Taÿgetus or slopes

				 				Of Erymanthus﻿—chases joyously

				 				Boars and fleet stags, and round her in a throng

				 				Frolic the rural nymphs, Latona’s heart

				 				Is glad, for over all the rest are seen

				 				Her daughter’s head and brow, and she at once

				 				Is known among them, though they all are fair,

				 				Such was this spotless virgin midst her maids.



			 				Now when they were about to move for home

				 				With harnessed mules and with the shining robes

				 				Carefully folded, then the blue-eyed maid,

				 				Pallas, bethought herself of this﻿—to rouse

				 				Ulysses and to bring him to behold

				 				The bright-eyed maiden, that she might direct

				 				The stranger’s way to the Phaeacian town.

				 				The royal damsel at a handmaid cast

				 				The ball; it missed, and fell into the stream

				 				Where a deep eddy whirled. All shrieked aloud.

				 				The great Ulysses started from his sleep

				 				And sat upright, discoursing to himself:﻿—



			 				“Ah me! upon what region am I thrown?

				 				What men are here﻿—wild, savage, and unjust,

				 				Or hospitable, and who hold the gods

				 				In reverence? There are voices in the air,

				 				Womanly voices, as of nymphs that haunt

				 				The mountain summits, and the river-founts,

				 				And the moist grassy meadows. Or perchance

				 				Am I near men who have the power of speech?

				 				Nay, let me then go forth at once and learn.”



			 				Thus having said, the great Ulysses left

				 				The thicket. From the close-grown wood he rent,

				 				With his strong hand, a branch well set with leaves

				 				And wound it as a covering round his waist.

				 				Then like a mountain lion he went forth,

				 				That walks abroad, confiding in his strength,

				 				In rain and wind; his eyes shoot fire; he falls

				 				On oxen, or on sheep, or forest-deer,

				 				For hunger prompts him even to attack

				 				The flock within its closely guarded fold.

				 				Such seemed Ulysses when about to meet

				 				Those fair-haired maidens, naked as he was,

				 				But forced by strong necessity. To them

				 				His look was frightful, for his limbs were foul

				 				With sea-foam yet. To right and left they fled

				 				Along the jutting riverbanks. Alone

				 				The daughter of Alcinoüs kept her place,

				 				For Pallas gave her courage and forbade

				 				Her limbs to tremble. So she waited there.

				 				Ulysses pondered whether to approach

				 				The bright-eyed damsel and embrace her knees

				 				And supplicate, or, keeping yet aloof,

				 				Pray her with soothing words to show the way

				 				Townward and give him garments. Musing thus,

				 				It seemed the best to keep at distance still,

				 				And use soft words, lest, should he clasp her knees,

				 				The maid might be displeased. With gentle words

				 				Skilfully ordered thus Ulysses spake:﻿—



			 				“O queen, I am thy suppliant, whether thou

				 				Be mortal or a goddess. If perchance

				 				Thou art of that immortal race who dwell

				 				In the broad heaven, thou art, I deem, most like

				 				To Dian, daughter of imperial Jove,

				 				In shape, in stature, and in noble air.

				 				If mortal and a dweller of the earth,

				 				Thrice happy are thy father and his queen,

				 				Thrice happy are thy brothers; and their hearts

				 				Must overflow with gladness for thy sake,

				 				Beholding such a scion of their house

				 				Enter the choral dance. But happiest he

				 				Beyond them all, who, bringing princely gifts,

				 				Shall bear thee to his home a bride; for sure

				 				I never looked on one of mortal race,

				 				Woman or man, like thee, and as I gaze

				 				I wonder. Like to thee I saw of late,

				 				In Delos, a young palm-tree growing up

				 				Beside Apollo’s altar; for I sailed

				 				To Delos, with much people following me,

				 				On a disastrous voyage. Long I gazed

				 				Upon it wonder-struck, as I am now﻿—

				 				For never from the earth so fair a tree

				 				Had sprung. So marvel I, and am amazed

				 				At thee, O lady, and in awe forbear

				 				To clasp thy knees. Yet much have I endured.

				 				It was but yestereve that I escaped

				 				From the black sea, upon the twentieth day,

				 				So long the billows and the rushing gales

				 				Farther and farther from Ogygia’s isle

				 				Had borne me. Now upon this shore some god

				 				Casts me, perchance to meet new sufferings here;

				 				For yet the end is not, and many things

				 				The gods must first accomplish. But do thou,

				 				queen, have pity on me, since to thee

				 				I come the first of all. I do not know

				 				A single dweller of the land beside.

				 				Show me, I pray, thy city; and bestow

				 				Some poor old robe to wrap me﻿—if, indeed,

				 				In coming hither, thou hast brought with thee

				 				Aught poor or coarse. And may the gods vouchsafe

				 				To thee whatever blessing thou canst wish,

				 				Husband and home and wedded harmony.

				 				There is no better, no more blessed state,

				 				Than when the wife and husband in accord

				 				Order their household lovingly. Then those

				 				Repine who hate them, those who wish them well

				 				Rejoice, and they themselves the most of all.”

				 				And then the white-armed maid Nausicaä said:﻿—

				 				“Since then, O stranger, thou art not malign

				 				Of purpose nor weak-minded﻿—yet, in truth,

				 				Olympian Jupiter bestows the goods

				 				Of fortune on the noble and the base

				 				To each one at his pleasure; and thy griefs

				 				Are doubtless sent by him, and it is fit

				 				That thou submit in patience﻿—now that thou

				 				Hast reached our lands, and art within our realm,

				 				Thou shalt not lack for garments nor for aught

				 				Due to a suppliant stranger in his need.

				 				The city I will show thee, and will name

				 				Its dwellers﻿—the Phaeacians﻿—they possess

				 				The city; all the region lying round

				 				Is theirs, and I am daughter of the prince

				 				Alcinoüs, large of soul, to whom are given

				 				The rule of the Phaeacians and their power.”



			 				So spake the damsel, and commanded thus

				 				Her fair-haired maids: “Stay! whither do ye flee,

				 				My handmaids, when a man appears in sight?

				 				Ye think, perhaps, he is some enemy.

				 				Nay, there is no man living now, nor yet

				 				Will live, to enter, bringing war, the land

				 				Of the Phaeacians. Very dear are they

				 				To the great gods. We dwell apart, afar

				 				Within the unmeasured deep, amid its waves

				 				The most remote of men; no other race

				 				Hath commerce with us. This man comes to us

				 				A wanderer and unhappy, and to him

				 				Our cares are due. The stranger and the poor

				 				Are sent by Jove, and slight regards to them

				 				Are grateful. Maidens, give the stranger food

				 				And drink, and take him to the riverside

				 				To bathe where there is shelter from the wind.”



			 				So spake the mistress; and they stayed their flight

				 				And bade each other stand, and led the chief

				 				Under a shelter as the royal maid,

				 				Daughter of stout Alcinoüs, gave command,

				 				And laid a cloak and tunic near the spot

				 				To be his raiment, and a golden cruse

				 				Of limpid oil. Then, as they bade him bathe

				 				In the fresh stream, the noble chieftain said:﻿—



			 				“Withdraw, ye maidens, hence, while I prepare

				 				To cleanse my shoulders from the bitter brine,

				 				And to anoint them; long have these my limbs

				 				Been unrefreshed by oil. I will not bathe

				 				Before you. I should be ashamed to stand

				 				Unclothed in presence of these bright-haired maids.”



			 				He spake; they hearkened and withdrew, and told

				 				The damsel what he said. Ulysses then

				 				Washed the salt spray of ocean from his back

				 				And his broad shoulders in the flowing stream,

				 				And wiped away the sea-froth from his brows.

				 				And when the bath was over, and his limbs

				 				Had been anointed, and he had put on

				 				The garments sent him by the spotless maid,

				 				Jove’s daughter, Pallas, caused him to appear

				 				Of statelier size and more majestic mien,

				 				And bade the locks that crowned his head flow down,

				 				Curling like blossoms of the hyacinth.

				 				As when some skilful workman trained and taught

				 				By Vulcan and Minerva in his art

				 				Binds the bright silver with a verge of gold,

				 				And graceful is his handiwork, such grace

				 				Did Pallas shed upon the hero’s brow

				 				And shoulders, as he passed along the beach,

				 				And, glorious in his beauty and the pride

				 				Of noble bearing, sat aloof. The maid

				 				Admired, and to her bright-haired women spake:﻿—



			 				“Listen to me, my maidens, while I speak.

				 				This man comes not among the godlike sons

				 				Of the Phaeacian stock against the will

				 				Of all the gods of heaven. I thought him late

				 				Of an unseemly aspect; now he bears

				 				A likeness to the immortal ones whose home

				 				Is the broad heaven. I would that I might call

				 				A man like him my husband, dwelling here,

				 				And here content to dwell. Now hasten, maids,

				 				And set before the stranger food and wine.”



			 				She spake; they heard and cheerfully obeyed,

				 				And set before Ulysses food and wine.

				 				The patient chief Ulysses ate and drank

				 				Full eagerly, for he had fasted long.



			 				White-armed Nausicaä then had other cares.

				 				She placed the smoothly folded robes within

				 				The sumptuous chariot, yoked the firm-hoofed mules,

				 				And mounted to her place, and from the seat

				 				Spake kindly, counselling Ulysses thus:﻿—



			 				“Now, stranger, rise and follow to the town,

				 				And to my royal father’s palace I

				 				Will be thy guide, where, doubt not, thou wilt meet

				 				The noblest men of our Phaeacian race.

				 				But do as I advise﻿—for not inapt

				 				I deem thee. While we traverse yet the fields

				 				Among the tilth, keep thou among my train

				 				Of maidens, following fast behind the mules

				 				And chariot. I will lead thee in the way.

				 				But when our train goes upward toward the town,

				 				Fenced with its towery wall, and on each side

				 				Embraced by a fair haven, with a strait

				 				Of narrow entrance, where our well-oared barques

				 				Have each a mooring-place along the road,

				 				And there round Neptune’s glorious fane extends

				 				A marketplace, surrounded by huge stones,

				 				Dragged from the quarry hither, where is kept

				 				The rigging of the barques﻿—sailcloth and ropes﻿—

				 				And oars are polished there﻿—for little reck

				 				Phaeacians of the quiver and the bow,

				 				And give most heed to masts and shrouds and ships

				 				Well poised, in which it is their pride to cross

				 				The foamy deep﻿—when there I would not bring

				 				Rude taunts upon myself, for in the crowd

				 				Are brutal men. One of the baser sort

				 				Perchance might say, on meeting us: ‘What man,

				 				Handsome and lusty-limbed, is he who thus

				 				Follows Nausicaä? where was it her luck

				 				To find him? will he be her husband yet?

				 				Perhaps she brings some wanderer from his ship,

				 				A stranger from strange lands, for we have here

				 				No neighbors; or, perhaps, it is a god

				 				Called down by fervent prayer from heaven to dwell

				 				Henceforth with her. ’Tis well if she have found

				 				A husband elsewhere, since at home she meets

				 				Her many noble wooers with disdain;

				 				They are Phaeacians.’ Thus the crowd would say,

				 				And it would bring reproach upon my name.

				 				I too would blame another who should do

				 				The like, and, while her parents were alive,

				 				Without their knowledge should consort with men

				 				Before her marriage. Stranger, now observe

				 				My words, and thou shalt speedily obtain

				 				Safe-conduct from my father, and be sent

				 				Upon thy voyage homeward. We shall reach

				 				A beautiful grove of poplars by the way,

				 				Sacred to Pallas; from it flows a brook,

				 				And round it lies a meadow. In this spot

				 				My father has his country-grounds, and here

				 				His garden flourishes, as far from town

				 				As one could hear a shout. There sit thou down

				 				And wait till we are in the city’s streets

				 				And at my father’s house. When it shall seem

				 				That we are there, arise and onward fare

				 				To the Phaeacian city, and inquire

				 				Where dwells Alcinoüs the large-souled king,

				 				My father; ’tis not hard to find; a child

				 				Might lead thee thither. Of the houses reared

				 				By the Phaeacians there is none like that

				 				In which Alcinoüs the hero dwells.

				 				When thou art once within the court and hall,

				 				Go quickly through the palace till thou find

				 				My mother where she sits beside the hearth,

				 				Leaning against a column in its blaze,

				 				And twisting threads, a marvel to behold,

				 				Of bright sea-purple, while her maidens sit

				 				Behind her. Near her is my father’s throne,

				 				On which he sits at feasts, and drinks the wine

				 				Like one of the immortals. Pass it by

				 				And clasp my mother’s knees; so mayst thou see

				 				Soon and with joy the day of thy return,

				 				Although thy home be far. For if her mood

				 				Be kindly toward thee, thou mayst hope to greet

				 				Thy friends once more, and enter yet again

				 				Thy own fair palace in thy native land.”



			 				Thus having said, she raised the shining scourge

				 				And struck the mules, that quickly left behind

				 				The river. On they went with easy pace

				 				And even steps. The damsel wielded well

				 				The reins, and used the lash with gentle hand,

				 				So that Ulysses and her train of maids

				 				On foot could follow close. And now the sun

				 				Was sinking when they came to that fair grove

				 				Sacred to Pallas. There the noble chief

				 				Ulysses sat him down, and instantly

				 				Prayed to the daughter of imperial Jove:﻿—



			 				“O thou unconquerable child of Jove

				 				The Aegis-bearer! hearken to me now,

				 				Since late thou wouldst not listen to my prayer,

				 				What time the mighty shaker of the shores

				 				Pursued and wrecked me! Grant me to receive

				 				Pity and kindness from Phaeacia’s sons.”



			 				So prayed he, supplicating. Pallas heard

				 				The prayer, but came not to him openly.

				 				Awe of her father’s brother held her back;

				 				For he would still pursue with violent hate

				 				Ulysses, till he reached his native land.





						Book 						VII


					Reception of Ulysses by Alcinoüs


				 				Return of Nausicaä to the city, followed by Ulysses﻿—Palace and garden of Alcinoüs﻿—Reception of Ulysses by the queen and her husband﻿—Narrative given by Ulysses of his voyage and shipwreck.





				So prayed Ulysses the great sufferer.

				 				The strong mules bore the damsel toward the town,

				 				And when she reached her father’s stately halls

				 				She stopped beneath the porch. Her brothers came

				 				Around her, like in aspect to the gods,

				 				And loosed the mules, and bore the garments in.

				 				She sought her chamber, where an aged dame

				 				Attendant there, an Epirote, and named

				 				Eurymedusa, lighted her a fire.

				 				She by the well-oared galleys had been brought

				 				Beforetime from Epirus, and was given

				 				To king Alcinoüs, ruler over all

				 				Phaeacia’s sons, who hearkened to his voice

				 				As if he were a god. ’Twas she who reared

				 				White-armed Nausicaä in the royal halls,

				 				Tended her hearth, and dressed her evening meal.



			 				Now rose Ulysses up, and townward turned

				 				His steps, while friendly Pallas wrapt his way

				 				In darkness, lest someone among the sons

				 				Of the Phaeacians with unmannerly words

				 				Might call to him or ask him who he was.

				 				And just as he was entering that fair town

				 				The blue-eyed Pallas met him, in the form

				 				Of a young virgin with an urn. She stood

				 				Before him, and Ulysses thus inquired:﻿—



			 				“Wilt thou, my daughter, guide me to the house

				 				Where dwells Alcinoüs, he who rules this land?

				 				I am a stranger, who have come from far

				 				After long hardships, and of all who dwell

				 				Within this realm I know not even one.”



			 				Pallas, the blue-eyed goddess, thus replied:﻿—

				 				“Father and stranger, I will show the house;

				 				The dwelling of my own good father stands

				 				Close by it. Follow silently, I pray,

				 				And I will lead. Look not on any man

				 				Nor ask a question; for the people here

				 				Affect not strangers, nor do oft receive

				 				With kindly welcome him who comes from far.

				 				They trust in their swift barques, which to and fro,

				 				By Neptune’s favor, cross the mighty deep.

				 				Their galleys have the speed of wings or thought.”



			 				Thus Pallas spake, and quickly led the way.

				 				He followed in her steps. They saw him not﻿—

				 				Those trained Phaeacian seamen﻿—for the power

				 				That led him, Pallas of the amber hair,

				 				Forbade the sight, and threw a friendly veil

				 				Of darkness over him. Ulysses saw,

				 				Wondering, the haven and the gallant ships,

				 				The marketplace where heroes thronged, the walls

				 				Long, lofty, and beset with palisades,

				 				A marvel to the sight. But when they came

				 				To the king’s stately palace, thus began

				 				The blue-eyed goddess, speaking to the chief:﻿—



			 				“Father and stranger, here thou seest the house

				 				Which thou hast bid me show thee. Thou wilt find

				 				The princes, nurslings of the gods, within,

				 				Royally feasting. Enter, and fear not;

				 				The bold man ever is the better man,

				 				Although he come from far. Thou first of all

				 				Wilt see the queen. Aretè is the name

				 				The people give her. She is of a stock

				 				The very same from which Alcinoüs

				 				The king derives his lineage. For long since

				 				Nausithoüs, its founder, was brought forth

				 				To Neptune, the great Shaker of the shores,

				 				By Peribaea, fairest of her sex,

				 				And youngest daughter of Eurymedon,

				 				The large of soul, who ruled the arrogant brood

				 				Of giants, and beheld that guilty race

				 				Cut off, and perished by a fate like theirs.

				 				Her Neptune wooed; she bore to him a son,

				 				Large-souled Nausithoüs, whom Phaeacia owned

				 				Its sovereign. To Nausithoüs were born

				 				Rhexenor and Alcinoüs. He who bears

				 				The silver bow, Apollo, smote to death

				 				Rhexenor, newly wedded, in his home.

				 				He left no son, and but one daughter, named

				 				Aretè; her Alcinoüs made his wife,

				 				And honored her as nowhere else on earth

				 				Is any woman honored who bears charge

				 				Over a husband’s household. From their hearts

				 				Her children pay her reverence, and the king

				 				And all the people, for they look on her

				 				As if she were a goddess. When she goes

				 				Abroad into the streets, all welcome her

				 				With acclamations. Never does she fail

				 				In wise discernment, but decides disputes

				 				Kindly and justly between man and man.

				 				And if thou gain her favor, there is hope

				 				That thou mayst see thy friends once more, and stand

				 				In thy tall palace on thy native soil.”



			 				The blue-eyed Pallas, having spoken thus,

				 				Departed o’er the barren deep. She left

				 				The pleasant isle of Scheria, and repaired

				 				To Marathon and to the spacious streets

				 				Of Athens, entering there the massive halls

				 				Where dwelt Erectheus, while Ulysses toward

				 				The gorgeous palace of Alcinoüs turned

				 				His steps, yet stopped and pondered ere he crossed

				 				The threshold. For on every side beneath

				 				The lofty roof of that magnanimous king

				 				A glory shone as of the sun or moon.

				 				There from the threshold, on each side, were walls

				 				Of brass that led towards the inner rooms,

				 				With blue steel cornices. The doors within

				 				The massive building were of gold, and posts

				 				Of silver on the brazen threshold stood,

				 				And silver was the lintel, and above

				 				Its architrave was gold; and on each side

				 				Stood gold and silver mastiffs, the rare work

				 				Of Vulcan’s practised skill, placed there to guard

				 				The house of great Alcinoüs, and endowed

				 				With deathless life, that knows no touch of age.

				 				Along the walls within, on either side,

				 				And from the threshold to the inner rooms,

				 				Were firmly planted thrones on which were laid

				 				Delicate mantles, woven by the hands

				 				Of women. The Phaeacian princes here

				 				Were seated; here they ate and drank, and held

				 				Perpetual banquet. Slender forms of boys

				 				In gold upon the shapely altars stood,

				 				With blazing torches in their hands to light

				 				At eve the palace guests; while fifty maids

				 				Waited within the halls, where some in querns

				 				Ground small the yellow grain; some wove the web

				 				Or twirled the spindle, sitting, with a quick

				 				Light motion, like the aspen’s glancing leaves.

				 				The well-wrought tissues glistened as with oil.

				 				As far as the Phaeacian race excel

				 				In guiding their swift galleys o’er the deep,

				 				So far the women in their woven work

				 				Surpass all others. Pallas gives them skill

				 				In handiwork and beautiful design.

				 				Without the palace-court, and near the gate,

				 				A spacious garden of four acres lay.

				 				A hedge enclosed it round, and lofty trees

				 				Flourished in generous growth within﻿—the pear

				 				And the pomegranate, and the apple-tree

				 				With its fair fruitage, and the luscious fig

				 				And olive always green. The fruit they bear

				 				Falls not, nor ever fails in winter time

				 				Nor summer, but is yielded all the year.

				 				The ever-blowing west-wind causes some

				 				To swell and some to ripen; pear succeeds

				 				To pear; to apple apple, grape to grape,

				 				Fig ripens after fig. A fruitful field

				 				Of vines was planted near; in part it lay

				 				Open and basking in the sun, which dried

				 				The soil, and here men gathered in the grapes,

				 				And there they trod the winepress. Farther on

				 				Were grapes unripened yet, which just had cast

				 				The flower, and others still which just began

				 				To redden. At the garden’s furthest bound

				 				Were beds of many plants that all the year

				 				Bore flowers. There gushed two fountains: one of them

				 				Ran wandering through the field; the other flowed

				 				Beneath the threshold to the palace-court,

				 				And all the people filled their vessels there.

				 				Such were the blessings which the gracious gods

				 				Bestowed on King Alcinoüs and his house.



			 				Ulysses, the great sufferer, standing there,

				 				Admired the sight; and when he had beheld

				 				The whole in silent wonderment, he crossed

				 				The threshold quickly, entering the hall

				 				Where the Phaeacian peers and princes poured

				 				Wine from their goblets to the sleepless one,

				 				The Argus-queller, to whose deity

				 				They made the last libations when they thought

				 				Of slumber. The great sufferer, concealed

				 				In a thick mist, which Pallas raised and cast

				 				Around him, hastened through the hall and came

				 				Close to Aretè and Alcinoüs,

				 				The royal pair. Then did Ulysses clasp

				 				Aretè’s knees, when suddenly the cloud

				 				Raised by the goddess vanished. All within

				 				The palace were struck mute as they beheld

				 				The man before them. Thus Ulysses prayed:﻿—



			 				“Aretè, daughter of the godlike chief

				 				Rhexenor! to thy husband I am come

				 				And to thy knees, from many hardships borne,

				 				And to these guests, to whom may the good gods

				 				Grant to live happily, and to hand down,

				 				Each one to his own children, in his home,

				 				The wealth and honors which the people’s love

				 				Bestowed upon him. Grant me, I entreat,

				 				An escort, that I may behold again

				 				And soon my own dear country. I have passed

				 				Long years in sorrow, far from all I love.”



			 				He ended, and sat down upon the hearth

				 				Among the ashes, near the fire, and all

				 				Were silent utterly. At length outspake

				 				Echeneus, oldest and most eloquent chief

				 				Of the Phaeacians; large his knowledge was

				 				Of things long past. With generous intent,

				 				And speaking to the assembly, he began:﻿—



			 				“Alcinoüs, this is not a seemly sight﻿—

				 				A stranger sitting on the hearth among

				 				The cinders. All the others here await

				 				Thy order, and move not. I pray thee, raise

				 				The stranger up, and seat him on a throne

				 				Studded with silver. Be thy heralds called,

				 				And bid them mingle wine, which we may pour

				 				To Jove, the god of thunders, who attends

				 				And honors every suppliant. Let the dame

				 				Who oversees the palace feast provide

				 				Our guest a banquet from the stores within.”



			 				This when the reverend king Alcinoüs heard,

				 				Forthwith he took Ulysses by the hand﻿—

				 				That man of wise devices﻿—raised him up

				 				And seated him upon a shining throne,

				 				From which he bade Laodamas arise,

				 				His manly son, whose seat was next to his.



			 				“Now mingle wine, Protonoüs, in a vase,

				 				For all within the palace, to be poured

				 				To Jove, the god of thunders, who attends

				 				And honors every suppliant.” As he spake

				 				Protonoüs mingled the delicious wines,

				 				And passed from right to left, distributing

				 				The cups to all; and when they all had poured

				 				A part to Jove, and all had drunk their fill,

				 				Alcinoüs took the word, and thus he said:﻿—



			 				“Princes and chiefs of the Phaeacians, hear,

				 				I speak as my heart bids me. Since the feast

				 				Is over, take your rest within your homes.

				 				Tomorrow shall the Senators be called

				 				In larger concourse. We will pay our guest

				 				Due honor in the palace, worshipping

				 				The gods with solemn sacrifice. And then

				 				Will we bethink us how to send him home,

				 				That with no hindrance and no hardship borne

				 				Under our escort he may come again

				 				Gladly and quickly to his native land,

				 				Though far away it lie, and that no wrong

				 				Or loss may happen to him ere he set

				 				Foot on its soil; and there must he endure

				 				Whatever, when his mother brought him forth,

				 				Fate and the unrelenting Sisters spun

				 				For the newborn. But should he prove to be

				 				One of the immortals who has come from heaven,

				 				Then have the gods a different design.

				 				For hitherto the gods have shown themselves

				 				Visibly at our solemn hecatombs,

				 				And sat with us, and feasted like ourselves,

				 				And when the traveller meets with them alone,

				 				They never hide themselves; for we to them

				 				Are near of kin, as near as is the race

				 				Of Cyclops and the savage giant brood.”



			 				Ulysses the sagacious answered him:﻿—

				 				“Nay, think not so, Alcinoüs. I am not

				 				In form or aspect as the immortals are,

				 				Whose habitation is the ample heaven.

				 				But I am like whomever thou mayst know,

				 				Among mankind, inured to suffering;

				 				To them shouldst thou compare me. I could tell

				 				Of bitterer sorrows yet, which I have borne;

				 				Such was the pleasure of the gods. But now

				 				Leave me, whatever have my hardships been,

				 				To take the meal before me. Naught exceeds

				 				The impatient stomach’s importunity

				 				When even the afflicted and the sorrowful

				 				Are forced to heed its call. So even now,

				 				Midst all the sorrow that is in my heart,

				 				It bids me eat and drink, and put aside

				 				The thought of my misfortunes till itself

				 				Be satiate. But, ye princes, with the dawn

				 				Provide for me, in my calamity,

				 				The means to reach again my native land.

				 				For, after all my hardships, I would die

				 				Willingly, could I look on my estates,

				 				My servants, and my lofty halls once more.”



			 				He ended; they approved his words, and bade

				 				Set forward on his homeward way the guest

				 				Who spake so wisely. When they all had made

				 				Libations and had drunk, they each withdrew

				 				To sleep at home, and left the noble chief

				 				Ulysses in the palace, where with him

				 				Aretè and her godlike husband sat,

				 				While from the feast the maidens bore away

				 				The chargers. The white-armed Aretè then

				 				Began to speak; for when she cast her eyes

				 				On the fair garments which Ulysses wore,

				 				She knew the mantle and the tunic well,

				 				Wrought by herself and her attendant maids,

				 				And thus with winged words bespake the chief:﻿—



			 				“Stranger, I first must ask thee who thou art,

				 				And of what race of men. From whom hast thou

				 				Received those garments? Sure thou dost not say

				 				That thou art come from wandering o’er the sea.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:﻿—

				 				“ ’Twere hard, O sovereign lady, to relate

				 				In order all my sufferings, for the gods

				 				Of heaven have made them many; yet will I

				 				Tell all thou askest of me, and obey

				 				Thy bidding. Far within the ocean lies

				 				An island named Ogygia, where abides

				 				Calypso, artful goddess, with bright locks,

				 				Daughter of Atlas, and of dreaded power.

				 				No god consorts with her, nor anyone

				 				Of mortal birth. But me in my distress

				 				Some god conveyed alone to her abode,

				 				When, launching his white lightning, Jupiter

				 				Had cloven in the midst of the black sea

				 				My galley. There my gallant comrades all

				 				Perished, but I in both my arms held fast

				 				The keel of my good ship, and floated on

				 				Nine days till, on the tenth, in the dark night,

				 				The gods had brought me to Ogygia’s isle,

				 				Where dwells Calypso of the radiant hair

				 				And dreaded might, who kindly welcomed me,

				 				And cherished me, and would have made my life

				 				Immortal, and beyond the power of age

				 				In all the coming time. And there I wore

				 				Seven years away, still moistening with my tears

				 				The ambrosial raiment which the goddess gave.

				 				But when the eighth year had begun its round

				 				She counselled my departure, whether Jove

				 				Had so required, or she herself had changed

				 				Her purpose. On a raft made strong with clamps

				 				She placed me, sent on board an ample store

				 				Of bread and pleasant wine, and made me put

				 				Ambrosial garments on, and gave a soft

				 				And favorable wind. For seventeen days

				 				I held my steady course across the deep,

				 				And on the eighteenth day the shadowy heights

				 				Of your own isle appeared, and then my heart,

				 				Ill-fated as I was, rejoiced. Yet still

				 				Was I to struggle with calamities

				 				Sent by earthshaking Neptune, who called up

				 				The winds against me, and withstood my way,

				 				And stirred the boundless ocean to its depths.

				 				Nor did the billows surfer me to keep

				 				My place, but swept me, groaning, from the raft,

				 				Whose planks they scattered. Still I labored through

				 				The billowy depth, and swam, till wind and wave

				 				Drove me against your coast. As there I sought

				 				To land, I found the surges hurrying me

				 				Against huge rocks that lined the frightful shore,

				 				But, turning back, I swam again and reached

				 				A river and the landing-place I wished.

				 				Smooth, without rocks, and sheltered from the wind.

				 				I swooned, but soon revived. Ambrosial night

				 				Came on. I left the Jove-descended stream

				 				And slept among the thickets, drawing round

				 				My limbs the withered leaves, while on my lids

				 				A deity poured bounteously the balm

				 				Of slumber. All night long, among the leaves,

				 				I slept, with all that sorrow in my heart,

				 				Till morn, till noon. Then as the sun went down

				 				The balmy slumber left me, and I saw

				 				Thy daughter’s handmaids sporting on the shore,

				 				And her among them, goddess-like. To her

				 				I came a suppliant, nor did she receive

				 				My suit unkindly as a maid so young

				 				Might do, for youth is foolish. She bestowed

				 				Food and red wine abundantly, and gave,

				 				When I had bathed, the garments I have on.

				 				Thus is my tale of suffering truly told.”



			 				And then Alcinoüs answered him and said:﻿—

				 				“Stranger, one duty hath my child o’erlooked﻿—

				 				To bid thee follow hither with her maids,

				 				Since thou didst sue to her the first of all.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, thus replied:﻿—

				 				“Blame not for that, O hero, I entreat,

				 				Thy faultless daughter. She commanded me

				 				To follow with her maids, but I refrained

				 				For fear and awe of thee, lest, at the sight,

				 				Thou mightest be displeased; for we are prone

				 				To dark misgivings﻿—we, the sons of men.”

				 				Again Alcinoüs spake: “The heart that beats

				 				Within my bosom is not rashly moved

				 				To wrath, and better is the temperate mood.

				 				This must I say, O Father Jupiter,

				 				And Pallas and Apollo! I could wish

				 				That, being as thou art, and of like mind

				 				With me, thou wouldst receive to be thy bride

				 				My daughter, and be called my son-in-law,

				 				And here abide. A palace I would give,

				 				And riches, shouldst thou willingly remain.

				 				Against thy will let no Phaeacian dare

				 				To keep thee here. May Father Jove forbid!

				 				And that thou mayst be sure of my intent,

				 				I name tomorrow for thy voyage home.

				 				Sleep in thy bed till then; and they shall row

				 				O’er the calm sea thy galley, till thou come

				 				To thine own land and home, or wheresoe’er

				 				Thou wilt, though further off the coast should be

				 				Than far Euboea, most remote of lands﻿—

				 				So do the people of our isle declare,

				 				Who saw it when they over sea conveyed

				 				The fair-haired Rhadamanthus, on his way

				 				To visit Tityus, son of Earth. They went

				 				Thither, accomplishing with little toil

				 				Their voyage in the compass of a day,

				 				And brought the hero to our isle again.

				 				Now shalt thou learn, and in thy heart confess,

				 				How much our galleys and our youths excel

				 				With bladed oars to stir the whirling brine”



			 				So spake the king, and the great sufferer

				 				Ulysses heard with gladness, and preferred

				 				A prayer, and called on Jupiter and said:﻿—



			 				“Grant, Father Jove, that all the king has said

				 				May be fulfilled! so shall his praise go forth

				 				Over the foodful earth, and never die,

				 				And I shall see my native land again.”



			 				So they conferred. White-armed Aretè spake,

				 				And bade her maidens in the portico

				 				Place couches, and upon them lay fair rugs

				 				Of purple dye, and tapestry on these,

				 				And for the outer covering shaggy cloaks.

				 				Forth from the hall they issued, torch in hand;

				 				And when with speed the ample bed was made,

				 				They came and summoned thus the chief to rest:﻿—



			 				“Rise, stranger, go to rest; thy bed is made.”

				 				Thus spake the maidens, and the thought of sleep

				 				Was welcome to Ulysses. So that night

				 				On his deep couch the noble sufferer

				 				Slumbered beneath the sounding portico.

				 				Alcinoüs laid him down in a recess

				 				Within his lofty palace, near to whom

				 				The queen his consort graced the marriage-bed.





						Book 						VIII


					Festivals in Honor of Ulysses


				 				A general council of the Phaeacians, in which it is determined to send Ulysses home to Ithaca﻿—A solemn feast﻿—Lay of the Trojan War, sung by Demodocus, the minstrel﻿—Public games﻿—Ulysses conquers in throwing the discus﻿—The amour of Mars and Venus sung by Demodocus﻿—His song of the Trojan horse and the fall of Troy.





				When Morn appeared, the rosy-fingered child

				 				Of Dawn, Alcinoüs, mighty and revered,

				 				Rose from his bed. Ulysses, noble chief,

				 				Spoiler of cities, also left his couch.

				 				Alcinoüs, mighty and revered, went forth

				 				Before, and led him to the marketplace

				 				Of the Phaeacians, built beside the fleet,

				 				And there on polished stones they took their seats

				 				Near to each other. Pallas, who now seemed

				 				A herald of the wise Alcinoüs, went

				 				Through all the city, planning how to send

				 				Magnanimous Ulysses to his home,

				 				And came and stood by every chief and said:﻿—



			 				“Leaders and chiefs of the Phaeacians, come

				 				Speedily to the marketplace, and there

				 				Hear of the stranger who from wandering o’er

				 				The deep has come where wise Alcinoüs holds

				 				His court; in aspect he is like the gods.”



			 				She spake, and every mind and heart was moved,

				 				And all the marketplace and all its seats

				 				Were quickly filled with people. Many gazed,

				 				Admiring, on Laertes’ well-graced son;

				 				For on his face and form had Pallas shed

				 				A glory, and had made him seem more tall

				 				And of an ampler bulk, that he might find

				 				Favor with the Phaeacians, and be deemed

				 				Worthy of awe and able to achieve

				 				The many feats which the Phaeacian chiefs,

				 				To try the stranger’s prowess, might propose.



			 				And now when all the summoned had arrived,

				 				Alcinoüs to the full assembly spake:﻿—



			 				“Princes and chiefs of the Phaeacians, hear:

				 				I speak the promptings of my heart. This guest﻿—

				 				I know him not﻿—has come to my abode,

				 				A wanderer﻿—haply from the tribes who dwell

				 				In the far East, or haply from the West﻿—

				 				And asked an escort and safe-conduct home;

				 				And let us make them ready, as our wont

				 				Has ever been. No stranger ever comes

				 				Across my threshold who is suffered long

				 				To pine for his departure. Let us draw

				 				A dark-hulled ship down to the holy sea

				 				On her first voyage. Let us choose her crew

				 				Among the people, two-and-fifty youths

				 				Of our best seamen. Then make fast the oars

				 				Beside the benches, leave them there, and come

				 				Into our palace and partake in haste

				 				A feast which I will liberally spread

				 				For all of you. This I command the youths;

				 				But you, ye sceptred princes, come at once

				 				To my fair palace, that we there may pay

				 				The honors due our guest; let none refuse.

				 				Call also the divine Demodocus,

				 				The bard, on whom a deity bestowed

				 				In ample measure the sweet gift of song,

				 				Delightful when the spirit prompts the lay.”



			 				He spake, and led the way; the sceptred train

				 				Of princes followed him. The herald sought

				 				Meantime the sacred bard. The chosen youths

				 				Fifty-and-two betook them to the marge

				 				Of the unfruitful sea; and when they reached

				 				The ship and beach they drew the dark hull down

				 				To the deep water, put the mast on board

				 				And the ship’s sails, and fitted well the oars

				 				Into the leathern rings, and, having moored

				 				Their barque in the deep water, went with speed

				 				To their wise monarch in his spacious halls.

				 				There portico and court and hall were thronged

				 				With people, young and old in multitude;

				 				And there Alcinoüs sacrificed twelve sheep,

				 				Eight white-toothed swine, and two splayfooted beeves.

				 				And these they flayed, and duly dressed, and made

				 				A noble banquet ready. Then appeared

				 				The herald, leading the sweet singer in,

				 				Him whom the Muse with an exceeding love

				 				Had cherished, and had visited with good

				 				And evil, quenched his eyesight and bestowed

				 				Sweetness of song. Pontonoüs mid the guests

				 				Placed for the bard a silver-studded throne,

				 				Against a lofty column hung his harp

				 				Above his head, and taught him how to find

				 				And take it down. Near him the herald set

				 				A basket and fair table, and a cup

				 				Of wine, that he might drink when he desired;

				 				Then all put forth their hands and shared the feast.



			 				And when their thirst and hunger were allayed,

				 				The Muse inspired the bard to sing the praise

				 				Of heroes; ’twas a song whose fame had reached

				 				To the high heaven, a story of the strife

				 				Between Ulysses and Achilles, son

				 				Of Peleus, wrangling at a solemn feast

				 				Made for the gods. They strove with angry words,

				 				And Agamemnon, king of men, rejoiced

				 				To hear the noblest of the Achaian host

				 				Contending; for all this had been foretold

				 				To him in sacred Pythia by the voice

				 				Of Phoebus, when the monarch to inquire

				 				At the oracle had crossed the rock which formed

				 				Its threshold. Then began the train of woes

				 				Which at the will of sovereign Jupiter

				 				Befell the sons of Ilium and of Greece.



			 				So sang renowned Demodocus. Meanwhile

				 				Ulysses took into his brawny hands

				 				An ample veil of purple, drawing it

				 				Around his head to hide his noble face,

				 				Ashamed that the Phaeacians should behold

				 				The tears that flowed so freely from his lids.

				 				But when the sacred bard had ceased his song,

				 				He wiped the tears away and laid the veil

				 				Aside, and took a double beaker filled

				 				With wine, and poured libations to the gods.

				 				Yet when again the minstrel sang, and all

				 				The chiefs of the Phaeacian people, charmed

				 				To hear his music, bade the strain proceed,

				 				Again Ulysses hid his face and wept.

				 				No other eye beheld the tears he shed.

				 				Alcinoüs only watched him, and perceived

				 				His grief, and heard the sighs he drew, and spake

				 				To the Phaeacians, lovers of the sea:﻿—



			 				“Now that we all, to our content, have shared

				 				The feast and heard the harp, whose notes so well

				 				Suit with a liberal banquet, let us forth

				 				And try our skill in games, that this our guest,

				 				Returning to his country, may relate

				 				How in the boxing and the wrestling match,

				 				In leaping and in running, we excel.”



			 				He spake, and went before; they followed him.

				 				Then did the herald hang the clear-toned harp

				 				Again on high, and taking by the hand

				 				Demodocus, he led him from the place,

				 				Guiding him in the way which just before

				 				The princes of Phaeacia trod to see

				 				The public games. Into the marketplace

				 				They went; a vast innumerable crowd

				 				Pressed after. Then did many a valiant youth

				 				Arise﻿—Acroneus and Ocyalus,

				 				Elatreus, Nauteus, Prymneus, after whom

				 				Upstood Anchialus, and by his side

				 				Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus, Thoön, rose;

				 				Anabasineüs and Amphialus,

				 				A son of Polyneius, Tecton’s son;

				 				Then rose the son of Naubolus, like Mars

				 				In warlike port, Euryalus by name,

				 				And goodliest both in feature and in form

				 				Of all Phaeacia’s sons save one alone,

				 				Laodamas the faultless. Next three sons

				 				Of King Alcinoüs rose: Laodamas,

				 				Halius, and Clytoneius, like a god

				 				In aspect. Some of these began the games,

				 				Contending in the race. For them a course

				 				Was marked from goal to goal. They darted forth

				 				At once and swiftly, raising, as they ran,

				 				The dust along the plain. The swiftest there

				 				Was Clytoneius in the race. As far

				 				As mules, in furrowing the fallow ground,

				 				Gain on the steers, he ran before the rest,

				 				And reached the crowd, and left them all behind.

				 				Others in wrestling strove laboriously﻿—

				 				And here Euryalus excelled them all;

				 				But in the leap Amphialus was first;

				 				Elatreus flung the quoit with firmest hand;

				 				And in the boxer’s art Laodamas,

				 				The monarch’s valiant son, was conqueror.



			 				This when the admiring multitude had seen,

				 				Thus spake the monarch’s son, Laodamas:﻿—



			 				“And now, my friends, inquire we of our guest

				 				If he has learned and practised feats like these.

				 				For he is not ill-made in legs and thighs

				 				And in both arms, in firmly planted neck

				 				And strong-built frame; nor does he seem to lack

				 				A certain youthful vigor, though impaired

				 				By many hardships﻿—for I know of naught

				 				That more severely tries the strongest man,

				 				And breaks him down, than perils of the sea.”



			 				Euryalus replied: “Laodamas,

				 				Well hast thou said, and rightly: go thou now

				 				And speak to him thyself, and challenge him.”



			 				The son of King Alcinoüs, as he heard,

				 				Came forward, and bespake Ulysses thus:﻿—



			 				“Thou also, guest and father, try these feats,

				 				If thou perchance wert trained to them. I think

				 				Thou must be skilled in games, since there is not

				 				A greater glory for a man while yet

				 				He lives on earth than what he hath wrought out,

				 				By strenuous effort, with his feet and hands.

				 				Try, then, thy skill, and give no place to grief.

				 				Not long will thy departure be delayed;

				 				Thy barque is launched; the crew are ready here.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:﻿—

				 				“Why press me, O Laodamas! to try

				 				These feats, when all my thoughts are of my woes,

				 				And not of games? I, who have borne so much

				 				Of pain and toil, sit pining for my home

				 				In your assembly, supplicating here

				 				Your king and all the people of your land.”



			 				Then spake Euryalus with chiding words:﻿—

				 				“Stranger, I well perceive thou canst not boast,

				 				As many others can, of skill in games;

				 				But thou art one of those who dwell in ships

				 				With many benches, rulers o’er a crew

				 				Of sailors﻿—a mere trader looking out

				 				For freight, and watching o’er the wares that form

				 				The cargo. Thou hast doubtless gathered wealth

				 				By rapine, and art surely no athlete.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, frowned and said:﻿—

				 				“Stranger, thou speakest not becomingly,

				 				But like a man who recks not what he says.

				 				The gods bestow not equally on all

				 				The gifts that men desire﻿—the grace of form,

				 				The mind, the eloquence. One man to sight

				 				Is undistinguished, but on him the gods

				 				Bestow the power of words. All look on him

				 				Gladly; he knows whereof he speaks; his speech

				 				Is mild and modest; he is eminent

				 				In all assemblies, and, whene’er he walks

				 				The city, men regard him as a god.

				 				Another in the form he wears is like

				 				The immortals, yet has he no power to speak

				 				Becoming words. So thou hast comely looks﻿—

				 				A god would not have shaped thee otherwise

				 				Than we behold thee﻿—yet thy wit is small,

				 				And thy unmannerly words have angered me

				 				Even to the heart. Not quite unskilled am I

				 				In games, as thou dost idly talk, and once,

				 				When I could trust my youth and my strong arms,

				 				I think that in these contests I was deemed

				 				Among the first. But I am now pressed down

				 				With toil and sorrow; much have I endured

				 				In wars with heroes and on stormy seas.

				 				Yet even thus, a sufferer as I am,

				 				Will I essay these feats; for sharp have been

				 				Thy words, and they provoke me to the proof.”



			 				He spake, and rising with his mantle on

				 				He seized a broader, thicker, heavier quoit,

				 				By no small odds, than the Phaeacians used,

				 				And swinging it around with vigorous arm

				 				He sent it forth; it sounded as it went;

				 				And the Phaeacians, skilful with the oar

				 				And sail, bent low as o’er them, from his hand,

				 				Flew the swift stone beyond the other marks.

				 				And Pallas, in a human form, set up

				 				A mark where it descended, and exclaimed:﻿—



			 				“Stranger! a blind man, groping here, could find

				 				Thy mark full easily, since it is not

				 				Among the many, but beyond them all.

				 				Then fear thou nothing in this game at least;

				 				For no Phaeacian here can throw the quoit

				 				As far as thou, much less exceed thy cast.”



			 				She spake; Ulysses the great sufferer

				 				Heard, and rejoiced to know he had a friend

				 				In that great circle. With a lighter heart

				 				Thus said the chief to the Phaeacian crowd:﻿—



			 				“Follow that cast, young men, and I will send

				 				Another stone, at once, as far, perchance,

				 				Or further still. If there are others yet

				 				Who feel the wish, let them come forward here﻿—

				 				For much your words have chafed me﻿—let them try

				 				With me the boxing or the wrestling match,

				 				Or footrace; there is naught that I refuse﻿—

				 				Any of the Phaeacians. I except

				 				Laodamas; he is my host, and who

				 				Would enter such a contest with a friend?

				 				A senseless, worthless man is he who seeks

				 				A strife like this with one who shelters him

				 				In a strange land; he mars the welcome given.

				 				As for the rest, there is no rival here

				 				Whom I reject or scorn; for I would know

				 				Their prowess, and would try my own with theirs

				 				Before you all. At any of the games

				 				Practised among mankind I am not ill,

				 				Whatever they may be. The polished bow

				 				I well know how to handle. I should be

				 				The first to strike a foe by arrows sent

				 				Among a hostile squadron, though there stood

				 				A crowd of fellow-warriors by my side

				 				And also aimed their shafts. The only one

				 				Whose skill in archery excelled my own,

				 				When we Achaians drew the bow at Troy,

				 				Was Philoctetes; to all other men

				 				On earth that live by bread I hold myself

				 				Superior. Yet I claim no rivalry

				 				With men of ancient times﻿—with Hercules

				 				And Eurytus the Oechalian, who defied

				 				The immortals to a contest with the bow.

				 				Therefore was mighty Eurytus cut off.

				 				Apollo, angry to be challenged, slew

				 				The hero. I can hurl a spear beyond

				 				Where others send an arrow. All my fear

				 				Is for my feet, so weakened have I been

				 				Among the stormy waves with want of food

				 				At sea, and thus my limbs have lost their strength.”



			 				He ended here, and all the assembly sat

				 				In silence; King Alcinoüs only spake:﻿—



			 				“Stranger, since thou dost speak without offence,

				 				And but to assert the prowess of thine arm,

				 				Indignant that amid the public games

				 				This man should rail at thee, and since thy wish

				 				Is only that all others who can speak

				 				Becomingly may not in time to come

				 				Dispraise that prowess, now, then, heed my words,

				 				And speak of them within thy palace halls

				 				To other heroes when thou banquetest

				 				Beside thy wife and children, and dost think

				 				Of things that we excel in﻿—arts which Jove

				 				Gives us, transmitted from our ancestors.

				 				In boxing and in wrestling small renown

				 				Have we, but we are swift of foot; we guide

				 				Our galleys bravely o’er the deep; we take

				 				Delight in feasts; we love the harp, the dance,

				 				And change of raiment, the warm bath and bed.

				 				Rise, then, Phaeacian masters of the dance,

				 				And tread your measures, that our guest may tell

				 				His friends at home how greatly we surpass

				 				All other men in seamanship, the race,

				 				The dance, the art of song. Go, one of you,

				 				And bring Demodocus his clear-toned harp,

				 				That somewhere in our palace has been left.”



			 				Thus spake the godlike king. The herald rose

				 				To bring the sweet harp from the royal house.

				 				Then the nine umpires also rose, who ruled

				 				The games; they smoothed the floor, and made the ring

				 				Of gazers wider. Next the herald came,

				 				And brought Demodocus the clear-toned harp.

				 				The minstrel went into the midst, and there

				 				Gathered the graceful dancers; they were youths

				 				In life’s first bloom. With even steps they smote

				 				The sacred floor. Ulysses, gazing, saw

				 				The twinkle of their feet and was amazed.

				 				The minstrel struck the chords and gracefully

				 				Began the lay: he sang the loves of Mars

				 				And Venus of the glittering crown, who first

				 				Had met each other stealthily beneath

				 				The roof of Vulcan. Mars with many gifts

				 				Won her, and wronged her spouse, the King of Fire;

				 				But from the Sun, who saw their guilt, there came

				 				A messenger to Vulcan. When he heard

				 				The unwelcome tidings, planning his revenge,

				 				He hastened to his smithy, where he forged

				 				Chains that no power might loosen or might break,

				 				Made to hold fast forever. When the snare

				 				In all its parts was finished, he repaired,

				 				Angry with Mars, to where the marriage-bed

				 				Stood in his chamber. To the posts he tied

				 				The encircling chains on every side, and made

				 				Fast to the ceiling many, like the threads

				 				Spun by the spider, which no eye could see,

				 				Not even of the gods, so artfully

				 				He wrought them. Then, as soon as he had wrapped

				 				The snare about the bed, he feigned to go

				 				To Lemnos nobly built, most dear to him

				 				Of all the lands. But Mars, the god who holds

				 				The shining reins, had kept no careless watch,

				 				And when he saw the great artificer

				 				Depart he went with speed to Vulcan’s house,

				 				Drawn thither by the love of her who wears

				 				The glittering crown. There Cytherea sat,

				 				Arrived that moment from a visit paid.

				 				Entering, he took her by the hand and said:﻿—



			 				“Come, my beloved, let us to the couch.

				 				Vulcan is here no longer; he is gone,

				 				And is among the Sintians, men who speak

				 				A barbarous tongue, in Lemnos far away.”



			 				He spake, and she approved his words, and both

				 				Lay down upon the bed, when suddenly

				 				The network, wrought by Vulcan’s skilful hand,

				 				Caught them, and clasped them round, nor could they lift

				 				Or move a limb, and saw that no escape

				 				Was possible. And now approached the King

				 				Of Fire, returning ere he reached the isle

				 				Of Lemnos, for the Sun in his behalf

				 				Kept watch and told him all. He hastened home

				 				In bitterness of heart, but when he reached

				 				The threshold stopped. A fury without bounds

				 				Possessed him, and he shouted terribly,

				 				And called aloud on all the gods of heaven:﻿—



			 				“O Father Jove, and all ye blessed ones,

				 				And deathless! Come, for here is what will move

				 				Your laughter, yet is not to be endured.

				 				Jove’s daughter, Venus, thus dishonors me,

				 				Lame as I am, and loves the butcher Mars;

				 				For he is well to look at, and is sound

				 				Of foot, while I am weakly﻿—but for this

				 				Are none but my two parents to be blamed,

				 				Who never should have given me birth. Behold

				 				Where lie embraced the lovers in my bed﻿—

				 				A hateful sight. Yet they will hardly take

				 				Even a short slumber there, though side by side,

				 				Enamored as they are; nor will they both

				 				Be drowsy very soon. The net and chains

				 				Will hold them till her father shall restore

				 				All the large gifts which, on our marriage-day,

				 				I gave him to possess the impudent minx

				 				His daughter, who is fair, indeed, but false.”



			 				He spake, and to the brazen palace flocked

				 				The gods; there Neptune came, who shakes the earth;

				 				There came beneficent Hermes; there too came

				 				Apollo, archer-god; the goddesses,

				 				Through womanly reserve, remained at home.

				 				Meantime the gods, the givers of all good,

				 				Stood in the entrance; and as they beheld

				 				The cunning snare of Vulcan, there arose

				 				Infinite laughter from the blessed ones,

				 				And one of them bespake his neighbor thus:﻿—



			 				“Wrong prospers not; the slow o’ertakes the swift.

				 				Vulcan the slow has trapped the fleetest god

				 				Upon Olympus, Mars; though lame himself,

				 				His net has taken the adulterer,

				 				Who now must pay the forfeit of his crime.”



			 				So talked they with each other. Then the son

				 				Of Jove, Apollo, thus to Hermes said:﻿—



			 				“Hermes, thou son and messenger of Jove,

				 				And bountiful of gifts, couldst thou endure,

				 				Fettered with such strong chains as these, to lie

				 				Upon a couch with Venus at thy side?”



			 				The herald-god, the Argus-queller, thus

				 				Made answer: “Nay, I would that it were so,

				 				O archer-king, Apollo; I could bear

				 				Chains thrice as many, and of infinite strength,

				 				And all the gods and all the goddesses

				 				Might come to look upon me, I would keep

				 				My place with golden Venus at my side.”



			 				He spake, and all the immortals laughed to hear.

				 				Neptune alone laughed not, but earnestly

				 				Prayed Vulcan, the renowned artificer,

				 				To set Mars free, and spake these winged words:﻿—



			 				“Release thy prisoner. What thou dost require

				 				I promise here﻿—that he shall make to thee

				 				Due recompense in presence of the gods.”



			 				Illustrious Vulcan answered: “Do not lay,

				 				Earthshaking Neptune, this command on me,

				 				Since little is the worth of pledges given

				 				For worthless debtors. How could I demand

				 				My right from thee among the assembled gods,

				 				If Mars, set free, escape from debt and chains?”



			 				Again the god who shakes the earth replied:﻿—

				 				“Vulcan, though Mars deny the forfeit due,

				 				And take to flight, it shall be paid by me.”



			 				Again illustrious Vulcan said: “Thy word

				 				I ought not and I seek not to decline.”



			 				He spake, and then the might of Vulcan loosed

				 				The net, and, freed from those strong fetters, both

				 				The prisoners sprang away. Mars flew to Thrace,

				 				And laughter-loving Venus to the isle

				 				Of Cyprus, where at Paphos stand her grove

				 				And perfumed altar. Here the Graces gave

				 				The bath, anointed with ambrosial oil

				 				Her limbs﻿—such oil as to the eternal gods

				 				Lends a fresh beauty, and arrayed her last

				 				In graceful robes, a marvel to behold.



			 				So sang the famous bard, while inly pleased

				 				Ulysses heard, and pleased were all the rest,

				 				Phaeacia’s sons, expert with oar and sail.



			 				Alcinoüs called his sons Laodamas

				 				And Halius forth, and bade them dance alone,

				 				For none of all the others equalled them.

				 				Then taking a fair purple ball, the work

				 				Of skilful Polybus, and, bending back,

				 				One flung it toward the shadowy clouds on high,

				 				The other springing upward easily

				 				Grasped it before he touched the ground again.

				 				And when they thus had tossed the ball awhile,

				 				They danced upon the nourishing earth, and oft

				 				Changed places with each other, while the youths,

				 				That stood within the circle filled the air

				 				With their applauses; mighty was the din.

				 				Then great Ulysses to Alcinoüs said:﻿—

				 				“O King Alcinoüs! mightiest of the race

				 				For whom thou hast engaged that they excel

				 				All others in the dance, what thou hast said

				 				Is amply proved. I look and am amazed.”



			 				Well pleased Alcinoüs the mighty heard,

				 				And thus to his seafaring people spake:﻿—



			 				“Leaders and chiefs of the Phaeacians, hear!

				 				Wise seems the stranger. Haste we to bestow

				 				Gifts that may well beseem his liberal hests.

				 				Twelve honored princes in our land bear sway,

				 				The thirteenth prince am I. Let each one bring

				 				A well-bleached cloak, a tunic, and beside

				 				Of precious gold a talent. Let them all

				 				Be brought at once, that, having seen them here,

				 				Our guest may with a cheerful heart partake

				 				The evening meal. And let Euryalus,

				 				Who spake but now so unbecomingly,

				 				Appease him both with words and with a gift.”



			 				He spake; they all approved, and each one sent

				 				His herald with a charge to bring the gifts,

				 				And thus Euryalus addressed the king:﻿—



			 				“O King Alcinoüs, mightiest of our race,

				 				I will obey thee, and will seek to appease

				 				Our guest. This sword of brass will I bestow,

				 				With hilt of silver, and an ivory sheath

				 				New wrought, which he may deem a gift of price.”



			 				He spake, and gave the silver-studded sword

				 				Into his hand, and spake these winged words:﻿—



			 				“Stranger and father, hail! If any word

				 				That hath been uttered gave offence, may storms

				 				Sweep it away forever. May the gods

				 				Give thee to see thy wife again, and reach

				 				Thy native land, where all thy sufferings

				 				And this long absence from thy friends shall end!”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, thus replied:﻿—

				 				“Hail also, friend! and may the gods confer

				 				On thee all happiness, and may the time

				 				Never arrive when thou shalt miss the sword

				 				Placed in my hands with reconciling word!”



			 				He spake, and slung the silver-studded sword

				 				Upon his shoulders. Now the sun went down,

				 				And the rich presents were already brought.

				 				The noble heralds came and carried them

				 				Into the palace of Alcinoüs, where

				 				His blameless sons received and ranged them all

				 				In fair array before the queenly dame

				 				Their mother. Meantime had the mighty king

				 				Alcinoüs to his palace led the way,

				 				Where they who followed took the lofty seats,

				 				And thus Alcinoüs to Aretè said:﻿—



			 				“Bring now a coffer hither, fairly shaped,

				 				The best we have, and lay a well-bleached cloak

				 				And tunic in it; set upon the fire

				 				A brazen cauldron for our guest, to warm

				 				The water of his bath, that having bathed

				 				And viewed the gifts which the Phaeacian chiefs

				 				Have brought him, ranged in order, he may sit

				 				Delighted at the banquet and enjoy

				 				The music. I will give this beautiful cup

				 				Of gold, that he, in memory of me,

				 				May daily in his palace pour to Jove

				 				Libations, and to all the other gods.”

				 				He spake; Aretè bade her maidens haste

				 				To place an ample tripod on the fire.

				 				Forthwith upon the blazing fire they set

				 				A laver with three feet, and in it poured

				 				Water, and heaped fresh fuel on the flames.

				 				The flames crept up the vessel’s swelling sides,

				 				And warmed the water. Meantime from her room

				 				Aretè brought a beautiful chest, in which

				 				She laid the presents destined for her guest﻿—

				 				Garments and gold which the Phaeacians gave﻿—

				 				And laid the cloak and tunic with the rest,

				 				And thus in winged words addressed the chief:﻿—



			 				“Look to the lid thyself, and cast a cord

				 				Around it, lest, upon thy voyage home,

				 				Thou suffer loss, when haply thou shalt take

				 				A pleasant slumber in the dark-hulled ship.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, heard, and straight

				 				He fitted to its place the lid, and wound

				 				And knotted artfully around the chest

				 				A cord, as queenly Circè long before

				 				Had taught him. Then to call him to the bath

				 				The housewife of the palace came. He saw

				 				Gladly the steaming laver, for not oft

				 				Had he been cared for thus, since he had left

				 				The dwelling of the nymph with amber hair,

				 				Calypso, though attended while with her

				 				As if he were a god. Now when the maids

				 				Had seen him bathed, and had anointed him

				 				With oil, and put his sumptuous mantle on,

				 				And tunic, forth he issued from the bath,

				 				And came to those who sat before their wine.

				 				Nausicaä, goddess-like in beauty, stood

				 				Beside a pillar of that noble roof,

				 				And looking on Ulysses as he passed,

				 				Admired, and said to him in winged words:﻿—



			 				“Stranger, farewell, and in thy native land

				 				Remember thou hast owed thy life to me.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answering said:﻿—

				 				“Nausicaä, daughter of the large-souled king

				 				Alcinoüs! so may Jove, the Thunderer,

				 				Husband of Juno, grant that I behold

				 				My home, returning safe, as I will make

				 				To thee as to a goddess day by day

				 				My prayer; for, lady, thou hast saved my life.”



			 				He spake, and near Alcinoüs took his place

				 				Upon a throne. And now they served the feast

				 				To each, and mingled wine. A herald led

				 				Thither the gentle bard Demodocus,

				 				Whom all the people honored. Him they placed

				 				Amidst the assembly, where he leaned against

				 				A lofty column. Sage Ulysses then

				 				Carved from the broad loin of a white-tusked boar

				 				A part, where yet a mass of flesh remained

				 				Bordered with fat, and to the herald said:﻿—



			 				“Bear this, O herald, to Demodocus,

				 				That he may eat. Him, even in my grief,

				 				Will I embrace, for worthily the bards

				 				Are honored and revered o’er all the earth

				 				By every race of men. The Muse herself

				 				Hath taught them song; she loves the minstrel tribe.”



			 				He spake; the herald laid the flesh before

				 				Demodocus the hero, who received

				 				The gift well pleased. Then all the guests put forth

				 				Their hands and shared the viands on the board;

				 				And when their thirst and hunger were allayed,

				 				Thus to the minstrel sage Ulysses spake:﻿—



			 				“Demodocus, above all other men

				 				I give thee praise, for either has the Muse,

				 				Jove’s daughter, or Apollo, visited

				 				And taught thee. Truly hast thou sung the fate

				 				Of the Achaian warriors﻿—what they did

				 				And suffered﻿—all their labors as if thou

				 				Hadst been among them, or hadst heard the tale

				 				From an eyewitness. Now, I pray, proceed,

				 				And sing the invention of the wooden horse

				 				Made by Epeius with Minerva’s aid,

				 				And by the chief Ulysses artfully

				 				Conveyed into the Trojan citadel,

				 				With armed warriors in its womb to lay

				 				The city waste. And I, if thou relate

				 				The story rightly, will at once declare

				 				To all that largely hath some bounteous god

				 				Bestowed on thee the holy gift of song.”



			 				He spake; the poet felt the inspiring god,

				 				And sang, beginning where the Argives hurled

				 				Firebrands among their tents, and sailed away

				 				In their good galleys, save the band that sat

				 				Beside renowned Ulysses in the horse,

				 				Concealed from sight, amid the Trojan crowd,

				 				Who now had drawn it to the citadel.

				 				So there it stood, while, sitting round it, talked

				 				The men of Troy, and wist not what to do.

				 				By turns three counsels pleased them﻿—to hew down

				 				The hollow trunk with the remorseless steel;

				 				Or drag it to a height, and cast it thence

				 				Headlong among the rocks; or, lastly, leave

				 				The enormous image standing and unharmed,

				 				An offering to appease the gods. And this

				 				At last was done; for so had fate decreed

				 				That they should be destroyed whene’er their town

				 				Should hold within its walls the horse of wood,

				 				In which the mightiest of the Argives came

				 				Among the sons of Troy to smite and slay.

				 				Then sang the bard how, issuing from the womb

				 				Of that deceitful horse, the sons of Greece

				 				Laid Ilium waste; how each in different ways

				 				Ravaged the town, while, terrible as Mars,

				 				Ulysses, joined with Menelaus, sought

				 				The palace of Deiphobus, and there

				 				Maintained a desperate battle, till the aid

				 				Of mighty Pallas made the victory his.



			 				So sang renowned Demodocus; the strain

				 				Melted to tears Ulysses, from whose lids

				 				They dropped and wet his cheeks. As when a wife

				 				Weeps her beloved husband, slain before

				 				His town and people, fighting to defend

				 				Them and his own dear babes from deadly harm,

				 				She sees him gasp and die, and at the sight

				 				She falls with piercing cries upon his corpse,

				 				Meantime the victors beat her on the back

				 				And shoulders with their spears, and bear her off

				 				To toil and grieve in slavery, where her cheeks

				 				In that long bitter sorrow lose their bloom;

				 				So from the eyelids of Ulysses fell

				 				The tears, yet fell unnoticed by them all

				 				Save that Alcinoüs, sitting at his side,

				 				Saw them, and heard his heavy sighs, and thus

				 				Bespake his people, masters of the oar:﻿—



			 				“Princes and chiefs of the Phaeacian race,

				 				Give ear. Let now Demodocus lay by

				 				His clear-toned harp. The matter of his song

				 				Delights not all alike. Since first we sat

				 				At meat, and since our noble bard began

				 				His lay, our guest has never ceased to grieve;

				 				Some mighty sorrow weighs upon his heart.

				 				Now let the bard refrain, that we may all

				 				Enjoy the banquet, both our guest and we

				 				Who welcome him, for it is fitting thus.

				 				And now are all things for our worthy guest

				 				Made ready, both the escort and these gifts,

				 				The pledges of our kind regard. A guest,

				 				A suppliant, is a brother, even to him

				 				Who bears a heart not easy to be moved.

				 				No longer, then, keep back with studied art

				 				What I shall ask; ’twere better far to speak

				 				With freedom. Tell the name thy mother gave,

				 				Thy father, and all those who dwell within,

				 				And round thy city. For no living man

				 				Is nameless from the time that he is born.

				 				Humble or high in station, at their birth

				 				The parents give them names. Declare thy land,

				 				Thy people, and thy city, that our ships

				 				May learn, and bear thee to the place; for here

				 				In our Phaeacian ships no pilots are,

				 				Nor rudders, as in ships of other lands.

				 				Ours know the thoughts and the intents of men.

				 				To them all cities and all fertile coasts

				 				Inhabited by men are known; they cross

				 				The great sea scudding fast, involved in mist

				 				And darkness, with no fear of perishing

				 				Or meeting harm. I heard Nausithoüs,

				 				My father, say that Neptune was displeased

				 				With us for safely bearing to their homes

				 				So many men, and that he would destroy

				 				In after time some good Phaeacian ship,

				 				Returning from a convoy, in the waves

				 				Of the dark sea, and leave her planted there,

				 				A mountain huge and high, before our town.

				 				So did the aged chieftain prophesy;

				 				The god, as best may please him, will fulfil

				 				My father’s words, or leave them unfulfilled.

				 				Now tell me truly whither thou hast roamed,

				 				And what the tribes of men that thou hast seen;

				 				Tell which of them are savage, rude, unjust,

				 				And which are hospitable and revere

				 				The blessed gods. Declare why thou didst weep

				 				And sigh when hearing what unhappy fate

				 				Befell the Argive and Achaian host

				 				And town of Troy. The gods decreed it; they

				 				Ordain destruction to the sons of men,

				 				A theme of song thereafter. Hadst thou not

				 				Some valiant kinsman who was slain at Troy?

				 				A son-in-law? the father of thy wife?

				 				Nearest of all are they to us, save those

				 				Of our own blood. Or haply might it be

				 				Some bosom-friend, one eminently graced

				 				With all that wins our love; for not less dear

				 				Than if he were a brother should we hold

				 				The wise and gentle man who is our friend.”





						Book 						IX


					The Ciconians, Lotus-Eaters, and Cyclops


				 				The adventures of Ulysses after the fall of Troy related by him at the request of Alcinoüs﻿—His attack on the Ciconians and the destruction of their city﻿—Rally and reinforcement of the Ciconians, who slaughter many of the companions of Ulysses﻿—The lotus-eaters, who subsist on flowers﻿—Arrival of Ulysses at the land of the cyclops﻿—Polyphemus and his barbarities﻿—Revenge of Ulysses, who puts out the single eye of Polyphemus and escapes.





				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:﻿—

				 				“O King Alcinoüs, most renowned of men!

				 				A pleasant thing it is to hear a bard

				 				Like this, endowed with such a voice, so like

				 				The voices of the gods. Nor can I deem

				 				Aught more delightful than the general joy

				 				Of a whole people when the assembled guests

				 				Seated in order in the royal halls

				 				Are listening to the minstrel, while the board

				 				Is spread with bread and meats, and from the jars

				 				The cupbearer draws wine and fills the cups.

				 				To me there is no more delightful sight.



			 				“But now thy mind is moved to ask of me

				 				The story of the sufferings I have borne,

				 				And that will wake my grief anew. What first,

				 				What next, shall I relate? what last of all?

				 				For manifold are the misfortunes cast

				 				Upon me by the immortals. Let me first

				 				Declare my name, that ye may know, and I

				 				Perchance, before my day of death shall come,

				 				May be your host, though dwelling far away.

				 				I am Ulysses, and my father’s name

				 				Laertes; widely am I known to men

				 				As quick in shrewd devices, and my fame

				 				Hath reached to heaven. In sunny Ithaca

				 				I dwell, where high Neritus, seen afar,

				 				Rustles with woods. Around are many isles,

				 				Well peopled, near each other. Samos there

				 				Lies, with Dulichium, and Zacynthus dark

				 				With forests. Ithaca, with its low shores,

				 				Lies highest toward the setting sun; the rest

				 				Are on the side where first the morning breaks.

				 				A rugged region ’tis, but nourishes

				 				Nobly its youths, nor have I ever seen

				 				A sweeter spot on earth. Calypso late,

				 				That glorious goddess, in her grotto long

				 				Detained me from it, and desired that I

				 				Should be her husband; in her royal home

				 				Aeëan Circè, mistress of strange arts,

				 				Detained me also, and desired that I

				 				Should be her husband﻿—yet they could not move

				 				The purpose of my heart. For there is naught

				 				More sweet and dear than our own native land

				 				And parents, though perchance our lot be cast

				 				In a rich home, yet far from our own kin

				 				And in a foreign land. Now let me speak

				 				Of the calamitous voyage which the will

				 				Of Jove ordained on my return from Troy.



			 				“The wind that blew me from the Trojan shore

				 				Bore me to the Ciconians, who abode

				 				In Ismarus. I laid the city waste

				 				And slew its dwellers, carried off their wives

				 				And all their wealth and parted them among

				 				My men, that none might want an equal share.

				 				And then I warned them with all haste to leave

				 				The region. Madmen! they obeyed me not.



			 				“And there they drank much wine, and on the beach

				 				Slew many sheep and many slow-paced steers

				 				With crumpled horns. Then the Ciconians called

				 				To their Ciconian neighbors, braver men

				 				Than they, and more in number, whose abode

				 				Was on the mainland, trained to fight from steeds,

				 				Or, if need were, on foot. In swarms they came,

				 				Thick as new leaves or morning flowers in spring.

				 				Then fell on our unhappy company

				 				An evil fate from Jove, and many griefs.

				 				They formed their lines, and fought at our good ships,

				 				Where man encountered man with brazen spears.

				 				While yet ’twas morning, and the holy light

				 				Of day waxed brighter, we withstood the assault

				 				And kept our ground, although more numerous they.

				 				But when the sun was sloping toward the west

				 				The enemy prevailed; the Achaian band

				 				Was routed, and was made to flee. That day

				 				There perished from each galley of our fleet

				 				Six valiant men; the rest escaped with life.



			 				“Onward we sailed, lamenting bitterly

				 				Our comrades slain, yet happy to escape

				 				From death ourselves. Nor did we put to sea

				 				In our good ships until we thrice had called

				 				Aloud by name each one of our poor friends

				 				Who fell in battle by Ciconian hands.

				 				The Cloud-compeller, Jove, against us sent

				 				The north-wind in a hurricane, and wrapped

				 				The earth and heaven in clouds, and from the skies

				 				Fell suddenly the night. With stooping masts

				 				Our galleys scudded; the strong tempest split

				 				And tore the sails; we drew and laid them down

				 				Within the ships, in fear of utter wreck,

				 				And toward the mainland eagerly we turned

				 				The rudders. There we lay two days and nights,

				 				Worn out with grief and hardship. When at length

				 				The fair-haired Morning brought the third day round,

				 				We raised the masts, and, spreading the white sails

				 				To take the wind, we sat us down. The wind

				 				Carried us forward with the pilot’s aid;

				 				And then should I have reached my native land

				 				Safely, had not the currents and the waves

				 				Of ocean and the north-wind driven me back,

				 				What time I strove to pass Maleia’s cape,

				 				And swept me to Cytherae from my course.



			 				“Still onward driven before those baleful winds

				 				Across the fishy deep for nine whole days,

				 				On the tenth day we reached the land where dwell

				 				The Lotus-eaters, men whose food is flowers.

				 				We landed on the mainland, and our crews

				 				Near the fleet galleys took their evening meal.

				 				And when we all had eaten and had drunk

				 				I sent explorers forth﻿—two chosen men,

				 				A herald was the third﻿—to learn what race

				 				Of mortals nourished by the fruits of earth

				 				Possessed the land. They went and found themselves

				 				Among the Lotus-eaters soon, who used

				 				No violence against their lives, but gave

				 				Into their hands the lotus plant to taste.

				 				Whoever tasted once of that sweet food

				 				Wished not to see his native country more,

				 				Nor give his friends the knowledge of his fate.

				 				And then my messengers desired to dwell

				 				Among the Lotus-eaters, and to feed

				 				Upon the lotus, never to return.

				 				By force I led them weeping to the fleet,

				 				And bound them in the hollow ships beneath

				 				The benches. Then I ordered all the rest

				 				Of my beloved comrades to embark

				 				In haste, lest, tasting of the lotus, they

				 				Should think no more of home. All straightway went

				 				On board, and on the benches took their place,

				 				And smote the hoary ocean with their oars.



			 				“Onward we sailed with sorrowing hearts, and reached

				 				The country of the Cyclops, an untamed

				 				And lawless race, who, trusting to the gods,

				 				Plant not, nor plough the fields, but all things spring

				 				For them untended﻿—barley, wheat, and vines

				 				Yielding large clusters filled with wine, and nursed

				 				By showers from Jove. No laws have they; they hold

				 				No councils. On the mountain heights they dwell

				 				In vaulted caves, where each one rules his wives

				 				And children as he pleases; none give heed

				 				To what the others do. Before the port

				 				Of that Cyclopean land there is an isle,

				 				Low-lying, neither near nor yet remote﻿—

				 				A woodland region, where the wild goats breed

				 				Innumerable; for the foot of man

				 				Disturbs them not, and huntsmen toiling through

				 				Thick woods, or wandering over mountain heights,

				 				Enter not here. The fields are never grazed

				 				By sheep, nor furrowed by the plough, but lie

				 				Untilled, unsown, and uninhabited

				 				By man, and only feed the bleating goats.

				 				The Cyclops have no barques with crimson prows,

				 				Nor shipwrights skilled to frame a galley’s deck

				 				With benches for the rowers, and equipped

				 				For any service, voyaging by turns

				 				To all the cities, as is often done

				 				By men who cross the deep from place to place,

				 				And make a prosperous region of an isle.

				 				No meagre soil is there; it well might bear

				 				All fruits in their due time. Along the shore

				 				Of the gray deep are meadows smooth and moist.

				 				The vine would flourish long; the ploughman’s task

				 				Is easy, and the husbandman would reap

				 				Large harvests, for the mould is rich below.

				 				And there is a safe haven, where no need

				 				Of cable is; no anchor there is cast,

				 				Nor hawsers fastened to the strand, but they

				 				Who enter there remain until it please

				 				The mariners, with favorable wind,

				 				To put to sea again. A limpid stream

				 				Flows from a fount beneath a hollow rock

				 				Into that harbor at its further end,

				 				And poplars grow around it. Thither went

				 				Our fleet; some deity had guided us

				 				Through the dark night, for nothing had we seen.

				 				Thick was the gloom around our barques; the moon

				 				Shone not in heaven, the clouds had quenched her light.

				 				No eye discerned the isle, nor the long waves

				 				That rolled against the shore, till our good ships

				 				Touched land, and, disembarking there, we gave

				 				Ourselves to sleep upon the waterside

				 				And waited for the holy Morn to rise.



			 				“And when at length the daughter of the Dawn,

				 				The rosy-fingered Morn, appeared, we walked

				 				Around the isle, admiring as we went.

				 				Meanwhile the nymphs, the daughters of the God

				 				Who bears the aegis, roused the mountain goats,

				 				That so our crews might make their morning meal.

				 				And straightway from our ships we took in hand

				 				Our crooked bows and our long-bladed spears.



			 				“ ‘Let all the rest of my beloved friends

				 				Remain, while I, with my own barque and crew,

				 				Go forth to learn what race of men are these,

				 				Whether ill-mannered, savage, and unjust,

				 				Or kind to guests and reverent toward the gods.’

				 				“I spake, and, having ordered all my crew

				 				To go on board and cast the hawsers loose,

				 				Embarked on my own ship. They all obeyed,

				 				And manned the benches, sitting there in rows,

				 				And smote the hoary ocean with their oars.

				 				But when we came upon that neighboring coast,

				 				We saw upon its verge beside the sea

				 				A cave high vaulted, overbrowed with shrubs

				 				Of laurel. There much cattle lay at rest,

				 				Both sheep and goats. Around it was a court,

				 				A high enclosure of hewn stone, and pines

				 				Tall stemmed, and towering oaks. Here dwelt a man

				 				Of giant bulk, who by himself, alone,

				 				Was wont to tend his flocks. He never held

				 				Converse with others, but devised apart

				 				His wicked deeds. A frightful prodigy

				 				Was he, and like no man who lives by bread,

				 				But more like a huge mountain summit, rough

				 				With woods, that towers alone above the rest.



			 				“Then, bidding all the others stay and guard

				 				The ship, I chose among my bravest men

				 				Twelve whom I took with me. I had on board

				 				A goatskin of dark wine﻿—a pleasant sort,

				 				Which Maron late, Evanthes’ son, a priest

				 				Of Phoebus, guardian god of Ismarus,

				 				Gave me, when, moved with reverence, we saved

				 				Him and his children and his wife from death.

				 				For his abode was in the thick-grown grove

				 				Of Phoebus. Costly were the gifts he gave﻿—

				 				Seven talents of wrought gold; a chalice all

				 				Of silver; and he drew for me, besides,

				 				Into twelve jars, a choice rich wine, unspoiled

				 				By mixtures, and a beverage for gods.

				 				No one within his dwellings, maids or men,

				 				Knew of it, save the master and his wife,

				 				And matron of the household. Whensoe’er

				 				They drank this rich red wine, he only filled

				 				A single cup with wine, and tempered that

				 				With twenty more of water. From the cup

				 				Arose a fragrance that might please the gods,

				 				And hard it was to put the draught aside.

				 				Of this I took a skin well filled, besides

				 				Food in a hamper﻿—for my thoughtful mind

				 				Misgave me, lest I should encounter one

				 				Of formidable strength and savage mood,

				 				And with no sense of justice or of right.



			 				“Soon were we at the cave, but found not him

				 				Within it; he was in the fertile meads,

				 				Tending his flocks. We entered, wondering much

				 				At all we saw. Around were baskets heaped

				 				With cheeses; pens were thronged with lambs and kids,

				 				Each in a separate fold; the elder ones,

				 				The younger, and the newly yeaned, had each

				 				Their place apart. The vessels swam with whey﻿—

				 				Pails smoothly wrought, and buckets into which

				 				He milked the cattle. My companions then

				 				Begged me with many pressing words to take

				 				Part of the cheeses, and, returning, drive

				 				With speed to our good galley lambs and kids

				 				From where they stabled, and set sail again

				 				On the salt sea. I granted not their wish;

				 				Far better if I had. ’Twas my intent

				 				To see the owner of the flocks and prove

				 				His hospitality. No pleasant sight

				 				Was that to be for those with whom I came.



			 				“And then we lit a fire, and sacrificed,

				 				And ate the cheeses, and within the cave

				 				Sat waiting, till from pasturing his flocks

				 				He came; a heavy load of well-dried wood

				 				He bore, to make a blaze at suppertime.

				 				Without the den he flung his burden down

				 				With such a crash that we in terror slunk

				 				Into a corner of the cave. He drove

				 				His well-fed flock, all those whose milk he drew,

				 				Under that spacious vault of rock, but left

				 				The males, both goats and rams, without the court.

				 				And then he lifted a huge barrier up,

				 				A mighty weight; not two-and-twenty wains,

				 				Four-wheeled and strong, could move it from the ground:

				 				Such was the enormous rock he raised, and placed

				 				Against the entrance. Then he sat and milked

				 				The ewes and bleating goats each one in turn,

				 				And gave to each its young. Next, half the milk

				 				He caused to curdle, and disposed the curd

				 				In woven baskets; and the other half

				 				He kept in bowls to be his evening drink.

				 				His tasks all ended thus, he lit a fire,

				 				And saw us where we lurked, and questioned us:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Who are ye, strangers? Tell me whence ye came

				 				Across the ocean. Are ye men of trade,

				 				Or wanderers at will, like those who roam

				 				The sea for plunder, and, with their own lives

				 				In peril, carry death to distant shores?’



			 				“He spake, and we who heard with sinking hearts

				 				Trembled at that deep voice and frightful form,

				 				And thus I answered: ‘We are Greeks who come

				 				From Ilium, driven across the mighty deep

				 				By changing winds, and while we sought our home

				 				Have made a different voyage, and been forced

				 				Upon another course; such was the will

				 				Of Jupiter. We boast ourselves to be

				 				Soldiers of Agamemnon, Atreus’ son,

				 				Whose fame is now the greatest under heaven,

				 				So mighty was the city which he sacked,

				 				So many were the warriors whom he slew;

				 				And now we come as suppliants to thy knees,

				 				And ask thee to receive us as thy guests,

				 				Or else bestow the gifts which custom makes

				 				The stranger’s due. Great as thou art, revere

				 				The gods; for suitors to thy grace are we,

				 				And hospitable Jove, whose presence goes

				 				With every worthy stranger, will avenge

				 				Suppliants and strangers when they suffer wrong.’



			 				“I spake, and savagely he answered me:﻿—

				 				‘Thou art a fool, O stranger, or art come

				 				From some far country﻿—thou who biddest me

				 				Fear or regard the gods. We little care﻿—

				 				We Cyclops﻿—for the Aegis-bearer, Jove,

				 				Or any other of the blessed gods;

				 				We are their betters. Think not I would spare

				 				Thee or thy comrades to avoid the wrath

				 				Of Jupiter, unless it were my choice;

				 				But say﻿—for I would know﻿—where hast thou left

				 				Thy gallant barque in landing? was it near,

				 				Or in some distant corner of the isle?’



			 				“He spake to tempt me, but I well perceived

				 				His craft, and answered with dissembling words:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Neptune, who shakes the shores, hath wrecked my barque

				 				On rocks that edge thine island, hurling it

				 				Against the headland. From the open sea

				 				The tempest swept it hitherward, and I,

				 				With these, escaped the bitter doom of death.’



			 				“I spake; the savage answered not, but sprang,

				 				And, laying hands on my companions, seized

				 				Two, whom he dashed like whelps against the ground.

				 				Their brains flowed out, and weltered where they fell.

				 				He hewed them limb from limb for his repast,

				 				And, like a lion of the mountain wilds,

				 				Devoured them as they were, and left no part﻿—

				 				Entrails nor flesh nor marrowy bones. We wept

				 				To see his cruelties, and raised our hands

				 				To Jove, and hopeless misery filled our hearts.

				 				And when the Cyclops now had filled himself,

				 				Devouring human flesh, and drinking milk

				 				Unmingled, in his cave he laid him down,

				 				Stretched out amid his flocks. The thought arose

				 				In my courageous heart to go to him,

				 				And draw the trenchant sword upon my thigh,

				 				And where the midriff joins the liver deal

				 				A stroke to pierce his breast. A second thought

				 				Restrained me﻿—that a miserable death

				 				Would overtake us, since we had no power

				 				To move the mighty rock which he had laid

				 				At the high opening. So all night we grieved,

				 				Waiting the holy Morn; and when at length

				 				That rosy-fingered daughter of the Dawn

				 				Appeared, the Cyclops lit a fire, and milked

				 				His fair flock one by one, and brought their young

				 				Each to its mother’s side. When he had thus

				 				Performed his household tasks, he seized again

				 				Two of our number for his morning meal.

				 				These he devoured, and then he moved away

				 				With ease the massive rock that closed the cave,

				 				And, driving forth his well-fed flock, he laid

				 				The massive barrier back, as one would fit

				 				The lid upon a quiver. With loud noise

				 				The Cyclops drove that well-fed flock afield,

				 				While I was left to think of many a plan

				 				To do him mischief and avenge our wrongs,

				 				If haply Pallas should confer on me

				 				That glory. To my mind, as I revolved

				 				The plans, this seemed the wisest of them all.



			 				“Beside the stalls there lay a massive club

				 				Of olive-wood, yet green, which from its stock

				 				The Cyclops hewed, that he might carry it

				 				When seasoned. As it lay it seemed to us

				 				The mast of some black galley, broad of beam,

				 				With twenty oarsmen, built to carry freight

				 				Across the mighty deep﻿—such was its length

				 				And thickness. Standing by it, I cut off

				 				A fathom’s length, and gave it to my men,

				 				And bade them smooth its sides, and they obeyed

				 				While I made sharp the smaller end, and brought

				 				The point to hardness in the glowing fire;

				 				And then I hid the weapon in a heap

				 				Of litter, which lay thick about the cave.

				 				I bade my comrades now decide by lot

				 				Which of them all should dare, along with me,

				 				To lift the stake, and with its point bore out

				 				Our enemy’s eye, when softly wrapped in sleep.

				 				The lot was cast, and fell on those whom most

				 				I wished with me﻿—four men, and I the fifth.



			 				“At eve the keeper of these fair-woolled flocks

				 				Returned, and brought his well-fed sheep and goats

				 				Into the spacious cavern, leaving none

				 				Without it, whether through some doubt of us

				 				Or through the ordering of some god. He raised

				 				The massive rock again, and laid it close

				 				Against the opening. Then he sat and milked

				 				The ewes and bleating goats, each one in turn,

				 				And gave to each her young. When he had thus

				 				Performed his household tasks, he seized again

				 				Two of our number for his evening meal.

				 				Then drew I near, and bearing in my hand

				 				A wooden cup of dark red wine I said:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Take this, O Cyclops, after thy repast

				 				Of human flesh, and drink, that thou mayst know

				 				What liquor was concealed within our ship.

				 				I brought it as an offering to thee,

				 				For I had hope that thou wouldst pity us,

				 				And send us home. Yet are thy cruelties

				 				Beyond all limit. Wicked as thou art,

				 				Hereafter who, of all the human race,

				 				Will dare approach thee, guilty of such wrong?’



			 				“As thus I spake, he took the cup and drank.

				 				The luscious wine delighted mightily

				 				His palate, and he asked a second draught.



			 				“ ‘Give me to drink again, and generously,

				 				And tell thy name, that I may make a gift

				 				Such as becomes a host. The fertile land

				 				In which the Cyclops dwell yields wine, ’tis true,

				 				And the large grapes are nursed by rains from Jove,

				 				But nectar and ambrosia are in this.’



			 				“He spake; I gave him of the generous juice

				 				Again, and thrice I filled and brought the cup,

				 				And thrice the Cyclops in his folly drank.

				 				But when I saw the wine begin to cloud

				 				His senses, I bespake him blandly thus:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Thou hast inquired, O Cyclops, by what name

				 				Men know me. I will tell thee, but do thou

				 				Bestow in turn some hospitable gift,

				 				As thou hast promised. Noman is my name,

				 				My father and my mother gave it me,

				 				And Noman am I called by all my friends.’



			 				“I ended, and he answered savagely:﻿—

				 				‘Noman shall be the last of all his band

				 				Whom I will eat, the rest will I devour

				 				Before him. Let that respite be my gift.’



			 				“He spake, and, sinking backward at full length,

				 				Lay on the ground, with his huge neck aside;

				 				All-powerful sleep had overtaken him.

				 				Then from his mouth came bits of human flesh

				 				Mingled with wine, and from his drunken throat

				 				Rejected noisily. I put the stake

				 				Among the glowing coals to gather heat,

				 				And uttered cheerful words, encouraging

				 				My men, that none might fail me through their fears.

				 				And when the olive-wood began to blaze﻿—

				 				For though yet green it freely took the lire﻿—

				 				I drew it from the embers. Round me stood

				 				My comrades, whom some deity inspired

				 				With calm, high courage. In their hands they took

				 				And thrust into his eye the pointed bar,

				 				While perched upon a higher stand than they

				 				I twirled it round. As when a workman bores

				 				Some timber of a ship, the men who stand

				 				Below him with a strap, on either side

				 				Twirl it, and round it spins unceasingly,

				 				So, thrusting in his eye that pointed bar,

				 				We made it turn. The blood came streaming forth

				 				On the hot wood; the eyelids and the brow

				 				Were scalded by the vapor, and the roots

				 				Of the scorched eyeball crackled with the fire.

				 				As when a smith, in forging axe or adze,

				 				Plunges, to temper it, the hissing blade

				 				Into cold water, strengthening thus the steel,

				 				So hissed the eyeball of the Cyclops round

				 				That olive stake. He raised a fearful howl;

				 				The rocks rang with it, and we fled from him

				 				In terror. Plucking from his eye the stake

				 				All foul and dripping with the abundant blood,

				 				He flung it madly from him with both hands.

				 				Then called he to the Cyclops who in grots

				 				Dwelt on that breezy height. They heard his voice

				 				And came by various ways, and stood beside

				 				The cave, and asked the occasion of his grief.



			 				“ ‘What hurts thee, Polyphemus, that thou thus

				 				Dost break our slumbers in the ambrosial night

				 				With cries? Hath any of the sons of men

				 				Driven off thy flocks in spite of thee, or tried

				 				By treachery or force to take thy life?’



			 				“Huge Polyphemus answered from his den:﻿—

				 				‘O friends! ’tis Noman who is killing me;

				 				By treachery Noman kills me; none by force’



			 				“Then thus with winged words they spake again:﻿—

				 				‘If no man does thee violence, and thou

				 				Art quite alone, reflect that none escape

				 				Diseases; they are sent by Jove. But make

				 				Thy prayer to Father Neptune, ocean’s king.’



			 				“So spake they and departed. In my heart

				 				I laughed to think that by the name I took,

				 				And by my shrewd device, I had deceived

				 				The Cyclops. Meantime, groaning and in pain,

				 				And groping with his hands, he moved away

				 				The rock that barred the entrance. There he sat,

				 				With arms outstretched, to seize whoever sought

				 				To issue from the cavern with the flock,

				 				So dull of thought he deemed me. Then I planned

				 				How best to save my comrades and myself

				 				From death. I framed a thousand stratagems

				 				And arts﻿—for here was life at stake, and great

				 				The danger was. At last I fixed on this.



			 				“The rams were plump and beautiful, and large

				 				With thick dark fleeces. These I silently

				 				Bound to each other, three and three, with twigs

				 				Of which that prodigy of lawless guilt,

				 				The Cyclops, made his bed. The middle ram

				 				Of every three conveyed a man; the two,

				 				One on each side, were there to make him safe.

				 				Thus each of us was borne by three; but I

				 				Chose for myself the finest one of all,

				 				And seized him by the back, and, slipping down

				 				Beneath his shaggy belly, stretched myself

				 				At length, and clung with resolute heart, and hands

				 				That firmly clenched the rich abundant fleece.

				 				Then sighed we for the holy Morn to rise.



			 				“And when again the daughter of the Dawn,

				 				The rosy-fingered Morn, looked forth, the males

				 				Went forth to pasture, while the ewes remained

				 				Within the stables, bleating, yet unmilked,

				 				For heavy were their udders. Carefully

				 				The master handled, though in grievous pain,

				 				The back of everyone that rose and passed,

				 				Yet, slow of thought, perceived not that my men

				 				Were clinging hid beneath their woolly breasts.

				 				As the last ram of all the flock went out,

				 				His thick fleece heavy with my weight, and I

				 				In agitated thought, he felt his back,

				 				And thus the giant Polyphemus spake:﻿—



			 				“ ‘My favorite ram, how art thou now the last

				 				To leave the cave? It hath not been thy wont

				 				To let the sheep go first, but thou didst come

				 				Earliest to feed among the flowery grass,

				 				Walking with stately strides, and thou wert first

				 				At the fresh stream, and first at eve to seek

				 				The stable; now thou art the last of all.

				 				Grievest thou for thy master, who has lost

				 				His eye, put out by a deceitful wretch

				 				And his vile crew, who stupefied me first

				 				With wine﻿—this Noman﻿—who, if right I deem,

				 				Has not escaped from death. O, didst thou think

				 				As I do, and hadst but the power of speech

				 				To tell me where he hides from my strong arm,

				 				Then should his brains, dashed out against the ground,

				 				Be scattered here and there; then should my heart

				 				Be somewhat lighter, even amid the woes

				 				Which Noman, worthless wretch, has brought on me!’



			 				“He spake, and sent him forth among the rest;

				 				And when we were a little way beyond

				 				The cavern and the court, I loosed my hold

				 				Upon the animal and unbound my men.

				 				Then quickly we surrounded and drove off,

				 				Fat sheep and stately paced, a numerous flock,

				 				And brought them to our ship, where joyfully

				 				Our friends received us, though with grief and tears

				 				For those who perished. Yet I suffered not

				 				That they should weep, but, frowning, gave command

				 				By signs to lift with speed the fair-woolled sheep

				 				On board, and launch our ship on the salt sea.

				 				They went on board, where each one took his place

				 				Upon the benches, and with diligent oars

				 				Smote the gray deep; and when we were as far

				 				As one upon the shore could hear a shout,

				 				Thus to the Cyclops tauntingly I called:﻿—

				 				“ ‘Ha! Cyclops! those whom in thy rocky cave

				 				Thou, in thy brutal fury, hast devoured,

				 				Were friends of one not unexpert in war;

				 				Amply have thy own guilty deeds returned

				 				Upon thee. Cruel one! who didst not fear

				 				To eat the strangers sheltered by thy roof,

				 				Jove and the other gods avenge them thus.’



			 				“I spake; the anger in his bosom raged

				 				More fiercely. From a mountain peak he wrenched

				 				Its summit, hurling it to fall beside

				 				Our galley, where it almost touched the helm.

				 				The rock dashed high the water where it fell,

				 				And the returning billow swept us back

				 				And toward the shore. I seized a long-stemmed pike

				 				And pushed it from the shore, encouraging

				 				The men to bend with vigor to their oars

				 				And so escape. With nods I gave the sign.

				 				Forward to vigorous strokes the oarsmen leaned

				 				Till we were out at sea as far from land

				 				As when I spake before, and then again

				 				I shouted to the Cyclops, though my crew

				 				Strove to prevent it with beseeching words,

				 				And one man first and then another said:﻿—



			 				“ ’O most unwise! why chafe that savage man

				 				To fury﻿—him who just has cast his bolt

				 				Into the sea, and forced us toward the land

				 				Where we had well-nigh perished? Should he hear

				 				A cry from us, or even a word of speech,

				 				Then would he fling a rock to crush our heads

				 				And wreck our ship, so fatal is his cast.’



			 				“He spake, but moved not my courageous heart;

				 				And then I spake again, and angrily:﻿—

				 				“ ‘Cyclops, if any man of mortal birth

				 				Note thine unseemly blindness, and inquire

				 				The occasion, tell him that Laertes’ son,

				 				Ulysses, the destroyer of walled towns,

				 				Whose home is Ithaca, put out thine eye.’



			 				“I spake; he answered with a wailing voice:﻿—

				 				‘Now, woe is me! the ancient oracles

				 				Concerning me have come to pass. Here dwelt

				 				A seer named Telemus Eurymides,

				 				Great, good, and eminent in prophecy,

				 				And prophesying he grew old among

				 				The Cyclops. He foretold my coming fate﻿—

				 				That I should lose my sight, and by the hand

				 				And cunning of Ulysses. Yet I looked

				 				For one of noble presence, mighty strength,

				 				And giant stature landing on our coast.

				 				Now a mere weakling, insignificant

				 				And small of stature, has put out my eye,

				 				First stupefying me with wine. Yet come

				 				Hither, I pray, Ulysses, and receive

				 				The hospitable gifts which are thy due;

				 				And I will pray to Neptune, and entreat

				 				The mighty god to guide thee safely home.

				 				His son am I, and he declares himself

				 				My father. He can heal me if he will,

				 				And no one else of all the immortal gods

				 				Or mortal men can give me back my sight.’



			 				“He spake; I answered: ‘Rather would I take

				 				Thy life and breath, and send thee to the abode

				 				Of Hades, where thou wouldst be past the power

				 				Of even Neptune to restore thine eye.’



			 				“As thus I said, the Cyclops raised his hands,

				 				And spread them toward the starry heaven, and thus

				 				Prayed to the deity who rules the deep:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Hear, dark-haired Neptune, who dost swathe the earth!

				 				If I am thine, and thou dost own thyself

				 				My father, grant that this Ulysses ne’er

				 				May reach his native land! But if it be

				 				The will of fate that he behold again

				 				His friends, and enter his own palace-halls

				 				In his own country, late and sorrowful

				 				Be his return, with all his comrades lost,

				 				And in a borrowed ship, and may he find

				 				In his own home new griefs awaiting him.’



			 				“He prayed, and Neptune hearkened to his prayer.

				 				And then the Cyclops seized another stone,

				 				Far larger than the last, and swung it round,

				 				And cast it with vast strength. It fell behind

				 				Our black-prowed galley, where it almost struck

				 				The rudder’s end. The sea was dashed on high

				 				Beneath the falling rock, and bore our ship

				 				On toward the shore we sought. When we reached

				 				The island where together in a fleet

				 				Our other galleys lay, we found our friends

				 				Sitting where they had waited long in grief.

				 				We touched the shore and drew our galley up

				 				On the smooth sand, and stepped upon the beach;

				 				And taking from on board the sheep that formed

				 				Part of the Cyclops’ flock, divided them,

				 				That none might be without an equal share.

				 				When all the rest were shared, my warrior friends

				 				Decreed the ram to me. Of him I made

				 				Upon the beach a sacrifice to Jove

				 				The Cloud-compeller, Saturn’s son, whose rule

				 				Is over all; to him I burned the thighs.

				 				He heeded not the offering; even then

				 				He planned the wreck of all my gallant ships,

				 				And death of my dear comrades. All that day

				 				Till set of sun we sat and feasted high

				 				Upon the abundant meats and delicate wine.

				 				But when the sun went down, and darkness crept

				 				Over the earth, we slumbered on the shore;

				 				And when again the daughter of the Dawn,

				 				The rosy-fingered Morn, looked forth, I called

				 				My men with cheerful words to climb the decks

				 				And cast the hawsers loose. With speed they went

				 				On board and manned the benches, took in hand

				 				The oars and smote with them the hoary deep.

				 				Onward in sadness, glad to have escaped,

				 				We sailed, yet sorrowing for our comrades lost.”

					Aeolus, the Lestrigonians, and Circè


				 				Arrival of Ulysses at the land of Aeolus, who gives him the winds in a bag﻿—Folly of the seamen, who untie the bag while Ulysses is asleep﻿—A tempest﻿—Disastrous encounter with the gigantic laestrigons﻿—Arrival at the island of Circè﻿—Transformation of the Greeks to swine, and recovery of their former shape﻿—Preparations for a journey to the region of the dead.





				“We reached the Aeolian isle, where Aeolus,

				 				Dear to the gods, a son of Hippotas,

				 				Made his abode. It was a floating isle;

				 				A wall of brass enclosed it, and smooth rocks

				 				Edged it around. Twelve children in his halls

				 				Were born, six daughters and six blooming sons;

				 				He gave his daughters to his sons for wives.

				 				And they with their dear father and his queen

				 				Banquet from day to day, with endless change

				 				Of meats before them. In his halls all day

				 				The sound of pipes is in the perfumed air;

				 				At night the youths beside their modest wives

				 				Sleep on fair couches spread with tapestry.

				 				So coming to his town and fair abode,

				 				I found a friendly welcome. One full month

				 				The monarch kept me with him, and inquired

				 				Of all that might concern the fate of Troy,

				 				The Argive fleet, and the return to Greece,

				 				And just as it befell I told him all.

				 				And when I spake to him of going thence,

				 				And prayed him to dismiss me, he complied,

				 				And helped to make us ready for the sea.

				 				The bladder of a bullock nine years old

				 				He gave, in which he had compressed and bound

				 				The stormy winds of air; for Saturn’s son

				 				Had given him empire o’er the winds, with power

				 				To calm them or to rouse them at his will.

				 				This in our roomy galley he made fast

				 				With a bright chain of silver, that no breath

				 				Of ruder air might blow. He only left

				 				The west wind free to waft our ships and us

				 				Upon our way. But that was not to be;

				 				We perished by a folly of our own.



			 				“Nine days we held our way, both day and night;

				 				And now appeared in sight our native fields

				 				On the tenth night, where on the shore we saw

				 				Men kindling fires. Meantime a pleasant sleep

				 				Had overcome my weary limbs, for long

				 				Had I been guiding with incessant toil

				 				The rudder, nor would trust it to the hand

				 				Of any other, such was my desire

				 				To reach our country by the shortest way.

				 				Then talked my crew among themselves, and said

				 				That I had brought with me from Aeolus,

				 				The large-souled son of Hippotas, rich gifts

				 				Of gold and silver. Standing side by side

				 				And looking at each other, thus they said:﻿—



			 				“ ‘How wonderfully is our chief revered

				 				And loved by all men, wander where he will

				 				Into what realm soever! From the coast

				 				Of Troy he sailed with many precious things,

				 				His share of spoil, while we, who with him went

				 				And with him came, are empty-handed yet;

				 				And now hath Aeolus, to show how much

				 				He prizes him, bestowed the treasures here.

				 				Come, let us see them; let us know how much

				 				Of gold and silver is concealed in this.’



			 				“Thus speaking to each other, they obeyed

				 				The evil counsel. They untied the sack,

				 				And straight the winds rushed forth and seized the ship,

				 				And swept the crews, lamenting bitterly,

				 				Far from their country out upon the deep;

				 				And then I woke, and in my noble mind

				 				Bethought me whether I should drop at once

				 				Into the deep and perish, or remain

				 				And silently endure and keep my place

				 				Among the living. I remained, endured,

				 				And covered with my mantle lay within

				 				My galley, while the furious whirlwind bore

				 				Back to the Aeolian isle our groaning crews.



			 				“We landed on the coast, and to our barques

				 				Brought water. Then my men prepared a meal

				 				Beside the fleet; and having tasted food

				 				And wine, I took a herald and a friend,

				 				And, hastening to the sumptuous palace-halls

				 				Of Aeolus, I found him with his wife

				 				And children banqueting. We sat us down

				 				Upon the threshold at the palace-doors,

				 				And they were all astonished, and inquired:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Why art thou here? What god thine enemy

				 				Pursues thee, O Ulysses! whom we sent

				 				So well prepared to reach thy native land,

				 				Thy home, or any place that pleased thee most?’



			 				“They spake, and sorrowfully I replied:﻿—

				 				‘The fault is all with my unthinking crew

				 				And my own luckless slumber. Yet, my friends,

				 				Repair the mischief, for ye have the power.’



			 				“Thus with submissive words I spake, but they

				 				Sat mute, the father only answered me:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Hence with thee! Leave our island instantly,

				 				Vilest of living men! It may not be

				 				That I receive or aid as he departs

				 				One who is hated by the blessed gods﻿—

				 				And thou art hated by the gods. Away!’



			 				“He spake, and sent us from the palace-door

				 				Lamenting. Sorrowfully went we on.

				 				And now with rowing hard and long﻿—the fruit

				 				Of our own folly﻿—all our crews lost heart,

				 				And every hope of safe return was gone.



			 				“Six days and nights we sailed; the seventh we came

				 				To lofty Laestrigoni with wide gates,

				 				The city of Lamos, where, on going forth,

				 				The shepherd calls to shepherd entering in.

				 				There might a man who never yields to sleep

				 				Earn double wages, first in pasturing herds,

				 				And then in tending sheep; for there the fields

				 				Grazed in the daytime are by others grazed

				 				At night. We reached its noble haven, girt

				 				By towering rocks that rise on every side,

				 				And the bold shores run out to form its mouth﻿—

				 				A narrow entrance. There the other crews

				 				Stationed their barques, and moored them close beside

				 				Each other, in that hill-encircled port.

				 				No billow, even the smallest, rises there;

				 				The water glimmers with perpetual calm.

				 				I only kept my dark-hulled ship without,

				 				And bound its cable to a jutting rock.



			 				“I climbed a rugged headland, and looked forth.

				 				No marks of tilth appeared, the work of men

				 				Or oxen, only smokes that from below

				 				Rose in the air. And then I sent forth scouts

				 				To learn what race of men who live by bread

				 				Inhabited the land. Two chosen men

				 				I sent, a herald made the third; and these

				 				Went inland by a level path, on which

				 				The wains brought fuel from the woody heights

				 				Into the city. On their way they met,

				 				Before the town, a damsel with an ewer﻿—

				 				The stately daughter of Antiphates,

				 				The Laestrigonian, who was coming down

				 				To where Artacia’s smoothly flowing fount

				 				Gave water for the city. They drew near

				 				And spake, and asked her who was sovereign there,

				 				And who his people. Straight she pointed out

				 				A lofty pile in which her father dwelt.

				 				They entered that proud palace, and beheld,

				 				Tall as a mountain peak, the monarch’s wife,

				 				And shuddered at the sight. With eager haste

				 				She called her husband, King Antiphates,

				 				From council. With a murderous intent

				 				He came, and, seizing one of my poor friends,

				 				Devoured him, while the other two betook

				 				Themselves to sudden flight and reached the ships.

				 				And then he raised a fearful yell that rang

				 				Through all the city. The strong Laestrigons

				 				Rushed forth by thousands from all sides, more like

				 				To giants than to common men. They hurled

				 				Stones of enormous weight from cliffs above,

				 				And cries of those who perished and the crash

				 				Of shattered galleys rose. They speared our friends

				 				Like fishes for their horrid feasts, and thus

				 				Bore them away. While those within the port

				 				Were slaughtered, drawing my good sword I cut

				 				The hawsers fastened to my ship’s blue prow,

				 				And cheered my men, and bade them fling themselves

				 				Upon the oars, that so we might escape

				 				Our threatened fate. They heard, and plied their oars

				 				Like men who rowed for life. The galley shot

				 				Forth from these beetling rocks into the sea

				 				Full gladly; all the others perished there.



			 				“Onward we sailed, with sorrow in our hearts

				 				For our lost friends, though glad to be reprieved

				 				From death. And now we landed at an isle﻿—

				 				Aeaea, where the fair-haired Circè dwelt,

				 				A goddess high in rank and skilled in song,

				 				Own sister of the wise Aeaetes. Both

				 				Were children of the source of light, the Sun,

				 				And Persè, Ocean’s daughter, brought them forth.

				 				We found a haven here, where ships might lie;

				 				And guided by some deity we brought

				 				Our galley silently against the shore,

				 				And disembarked, and gave two days and nights

				 				To rest, unmanned with hardship and with grief.



			 				“When bright-haired Morning brought the third day round,

				 				I took my spear and my good sword, and left

				 				The ship, and climbed a height, in hope to spy

				 				Some trace of human toil, or hear some voice.

				 				On a steep precipice I stood, and saw

				 				From the broad earth below a rising smoke,

				 				Where midst the thickets and the forest-ground

				 				Stood Circè’s palace. Seeing that dark smoke,

				 				The thought arose within my mind that there

				 				I should inquire. I pondered till at last

				 				This seemed the wisest﻿—to return at once

				 				To my good ship upon the ocean-side,

				 				And give my crew their meal, and send them forth

				 				To view the region. Coming to the spot

				 				Where lay my well-oared barque, some pitying god

				 				Beneath whose eye I wandered forth alone

				 				Sent a huge stag into my very path,

				 				High-horned, which from his pasture in the wood

				 				Descended to the riverside to drink,

				 				For grievously he felt the hot sun’s power.

				 				Him as he ran I smote; the weapon pierced,

				 				Just at the spine, the middle of his back.

				 				The brazen blade passed through, and with a moon

				 				He fell amid the dust, and yielded up

				 				His life. I went to him, and set my foot

				 				Against him, and plucked forth the brazen spear,

				 				And left it leaning there. And then I broke

				 				Lithe osiers from the shrubs, and twined of these

				 				A rope, which, doubled, was an ell in length.

				 				With that I tied the enormous creature’s feet,

				 				And slung him on my neck, and brought him thus

				 				To my black ship. I used the spear to prop

				 				My steps, since he no longer could be borne

				 				Upon the shoulder, aided by the hand,

				 				Such was the animal’s bulk. I flung him down

				 				Before the ship, encouraging my men

				 				With cheerful words, and thus I said to each:﻿—



			 				“ ‘My friends, we will not, wretched as we are,

				 				Go down to Pluto’s realm before our time.

				 				While food and wine are yet within the hold

				 				Of our good galley, let us not forget

				 				Our daily meals, and famine-stricken pine.’



			 				“I spake; they all obeyed, and at my word

				 				Came forth, and standing by the barren deep

				 				Admired the stag, for he was huge of bulk;

				 				And when their eyes were tired with wondering,

				 				My people washed their hands, and soon had made

				 				A noble banquet ready. All that day

				 				Till set of sun we sat and feasted there

				 				Upon the abundant meat and delicate wine;

				 				And when the sun went down, and darkness came,

				 				We slept upon the shore. But when the Morn,

				 				The rosy-fingered child of Dawn, looked forth,

				 				I called a council of my men and spake:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Give ear, my friends, amid your sufferings,

				 				To words that I shall say. We cannot here

				 				Know which way lies the west, nor where the east,

				 				Nor where the sun, that shines for all mankind,

				 				Descends below the earth, nor where again

				 				He rises from it. Yet will we consult,

				 				If room there be for counsel﻿—which I doubt,

				 				For when I climbed that height I overlooked

				 				An isle surrounded by the boundless deep﻿—

				 				An isle low lying. In the midst I saw

				 				Smoke rising from a thicket of the wood.’



			 				“I spake; their courage died within their hearts

				 				As they remembered what Antiphates,

				 				The Laestrigon, had done, and what foul deeds

				 				The cannibal Cyclops, and they wept aloud.

				 				Tears flowed abundantly, but tears were now

				 				Of no avail to our unhappy band.



			 				“Numbering my well-armed men, I made of them

				 				Two equal parties, giving each its chief.

				 				Myself commanded one; Eurylochus,

				 				The hero, took the other in his charge.



			 				“Then in a brazen helm we shook the lots;

				 				The lot of brave Eurylochus leaped forth,

				 				And he with two-and-twenty of our men

				 				Went forward with quick steps, and yet in tears,

				 				While we as sorrowful were left behind.



			 				“They found the fair abode where Circè dwelt,

				 				A palace of hewn stone within the vale,

				 				Yet nobly seated. There were mountain wolves

				 				And lions round it, which herself had tamed

				 				With powerful drugs; yet these assaulted not

				 				The visitors, but, wagging their long tails,

				 				Stood on their hinder feet, and fawned on them,

				 				Like mastiffs on their master when he comes

				 				From banqueting and brings them food. So fawned

				 				The strong-clawed wolves and lions on my men.

				 				With fear my men beheld those beasts of prey,

				 				Yet went, and, standing in the portico

				 				Of the bright-haired divinity, they heard

				 				Her sweet voice singing, as within she threw

				 				The shuttle through the wide immortal web,

				 				Such as is woven by the goddesses﻿—

				 				Delicate, bright of hue, and beautiful.



			 				“Polites then, a chief the most beloved

				 				And most discreet of all my comrades, spake:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Someone is here, my friends, who sweetly sings,

				 				Weaving an ample web, and all the floor

				 				Rings to her voice. Whoever she may be,

				 				Woman or goddess, let us call to her.’



			 				“He spake; aloud they called, and forth she came

				 				And threw at once the shining doors apart,

				 				And bade my comrades enter. Without thought

				 				They followed her. Eurylochus alone

				 				Remained without, for he suspected guile.

				 				She led them in and seated them on thrones.

				 				Then mingling for them Pramnian wine with cheese,

				 				Meal, and fresh honey, and infusing drugs

				 				Into the mixture﻿—drugs which made them lose

				 				The memory of their home﻿—she handed them

				 				The beverage and they drank. Then instantly

				 				She touched them with a wand, and shut them up

				 				In sties, transformed to swine in head and voice,

				 				Bristles and shape, though still the human mind

				 				Remained to them. Thus sorrowing they were driven

				 				Into their cells, where Circè flung to them

				 				Acorns of oak and ilex, and the fruit

				 				Of cornel, such as nourish wallowing swine.



			 				“Back came Eurylochus to our good ship

				 				With news of our poor comrades and their fate,

				 				He strove to speak, but could not; he was stunned

				 				By that calamity; his eyes were filled

				 				With tears, and his whole soul was given to grief.

				 				We marvelled greatly; long we questioned him,

				 				And thus he spake of our lost friends at last:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Through yonder thickets, as thou gav’st command,

				 				Illustrious chief! we went, until we reached

				 				A stately palace of hewn stones, within

				 				A vale, yet nobly seated. Someone there,

				 				Goddess or woman, weaving busily

				 				An ample web, sang sweetly as she wrought.

				 				My comrades called aloud, and forth she came,

				 				And threw at once the shining doors apart,

				 				And bade us enter. Without thought the rest

				 				Followed, while I alone, suspecting guile,

				 				Remained without. My comrades, from that hour,

				 				Were seen no more; not one of them again

				 				Came forth, though long I sat and watched for them.’



			 				“He spake; I slung my silver-studded sword

				 				Upon my shoulders﻿—a huge blade of brass﻿—

				 				And my bow with it, and commanded him

				 				To lead the way. He seized and clasped my knees

				 				With both his hands in attitude of prayer,

				 				And sorrowfully said these winged words:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Take me not thither; force me not to go,

				 				O foster-child of Jove! but leave me here;

				 				For thou wilt not return, I know, nor yet

				 				Deliver one of our lost friends. Our part

				 				Is to betake ourselves to instant flight

				 				With these who yet remain, and so escape.’



			 				“He spake, and I replied: ‘Eurylochus,

				 				Remain thou here, beside our roomy ship,

				 				Eating and drinking. I shall surely go.

				 				A strong necessity is laid on me.’



			 				“I spake, and from the ship and shore went up

				 				Into the isle; and when I found myself

				 				Within that awful valley, and not far

				 				From the great palace in which Circè dwelt,

				 				The sorceress, there met me on my way

				 				A youth; he seemed in manhood’s earJy prime,

				 				When youth has most of grace. He took my hand

				 				And held it, and, accosting me, began:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Rash mortal! whither art thou wandering thus

				 				Alone among the hills, where every place

				 				Is strange to thee? Thy comrades are shut up

				 				In Circè’s palace in close cells like swine.

				 				Com’st thou to set them free? Nay, thou like them

				 				Wilt rather find thyself constrained to stay.

				 				Let me bestow the means to make thee safe

				 				Against that mischief. Take this potent herb,

				 				And bear it with thee to the palace-halls

				 				Of Circè, and it shall avert from thee

				 				The threatened evil. I will now reveal

				 				The treacherous arts of Circè. She will bring

				 				A mingled draught to thee, and drug the bowl,

				 				But will not harm thee thus; the virtuous plant

				 				I gave thee will prevent it. Hear yet more:

				 				When she shall smite thee with her wand, draw forth

				 				Thy good sword from thy thigh and rush at her

				 				As if to take her life, and she will crouch

				 				In fear, and will solicit thine embrace.

				 				Refuse her not, that so she may release

				 				Thy comrades, and may send thee also back

				 				To thine own land; but first exact of her

				 				The solemn oath which binds the blessed gods,

				 				That she will meditate no other harm

				 				To thee, nor strip thee of thy manly strength.’



			 				“The Argus-queller spake, and plucked from earth

				 				The potent plant and handed it to me,

				 				And taught me all its powers. The root is black,

				 				The blossom white as milk. Among the gods

				 				Its name is Moly; hard it is for men

				 				To dig it up; the gods find nothing hard.



			 				“Back through the woody island Hermes went

				 				Toward high Olympus, while I took my way

				 				To Circè’s halls, yet with a beating heart.

				 				There, as I stood beneath the portico

				 				Of that bright-haired divinity, I called

				 				Aloud; the goddess heard my voice and came,

				 				And threw at once the shining doors apart,

				 				And prayed me to come in. I followed her,

				 				Yet grieving still. She led me in and gave

				 				A seat upon a silver-studded throne,

				 				Beautiful, nobly wrought, and placed beneath

				 				A footstool, and prepared a mingled draught

				 				Within a golden chalice, and infused

				 				A drug with mischievous intent. She gave

				 				The cup; I drank it off; the charm wrought not,

				 				And then she smote me with her wand and said:﻿—

				 				‘Go to the sty, and with thy fellows sprawl.’



			 				“She spake; but drawing forth the trusty sword

				 				Upon my thigh, I rushed at her as if

				 				To take her life. She shrieked and, stooping low,

				 				Ran underneath my arm and clasped my knees,

				 				And uttered piteously these winged words:﻿—

				 				“ ‘Who art thou? of what race and of what land,

				 				And who thy parents? I am wonder-struck

				 				To see that thou couldst drink that magic juice

				 				And yield not to its power. No living man,

				 				Whoever he might be, that tasted once

				 				Those drugs, or passed them o’er his lips, has yet

				 				Withstood them. In thy breast a spirit dwells

				 				Not to be thus subdued. Art thou not then

				 				Ulysses, master of wise stratagems,

				 				Whose coming hither, on his way from Troy,

				 				In his black galley, oft has been foretold

				 				By Hermes of the golden wand? But sheathe

				 				Thy sword and share my couch, that, joined in love,

				 				Each may hereafter trust the other’s faith.’



			 				“She spake, and I replied: ‘How canst thou ask,

				 				O Circè, that I gently deal with thee,

				 				Since thou, in thine own palace, hast transformed

				 				My friends to swine, and plottest even now

				 				To keep me with thee, luring me to pass

				 				Into thy chamber and to share thy couch,

				 				That thou mayst strip me of my manly strength

				 				I come not to thy couch till thou engage,

				 				O goddess, by a solemn oath, that thou

				 				Wilt never seek to do me further harm.’



			 				“I spake; she straightway took the oath required,

				 				And, after it was uttered and confirmed,

				 				Up to her sumptuous couch I went. Meanwhile

				 				Four diligent maidens ministered within

				 				The palace﻿—servants of the household they,

				 				Who had their birth from fountains and from groves,

				 				And sacred rivers flowing to the sea.

				 				One spread the thrones with gorgeous coverings;

				 				Above was purple arras, and beneath

				 				Were linen webs; another, setting forth

				 				The silver tables just before the thrones,

				 				Placed on them canisters of gold; a third

				 				Mingled the rich wines in a silver bowl,

				 				And placed the golden cups; and, last, the fourth

				 				Brought water from the fountain, and beneath

				 				A massive tripod kindled a great fire

				 				And warmed the water. When it boiled within

				 				The shining brass, she led me to the bath,

				 				And washed me from the tripod. On my head

				 				And shoulders pleasantly she shed the streams

				 				That from my members took away the sense

				 				Of weariness, unmanning body and mind.

				 				And when she thus had bathed me and with oil

				 				Anointed me, she put a princely cloak

				 				And tunic on me, led me in, and showed

				 				My seat﻿—a stately silver-studded throne,

				 				High-wrought﻿—and placed a footstool for my feet.

				 				Then came a handmaid with a golden ewer,

				 				And from it poured pure water for my hands

				 				Into a silver laver. Next she placed

				 				A polished table near to me, on which

				 				The matron of the palace laid the feast,

				 				With many delicacies from her store,

				 				And bade me eat. The banquet pleased me not.

				 				My thoughts were elsewhere; dark imaginings

				 				Were in my mind. When Circè marked my mood.

				 				As in a gloomy revery I sat,

				 				And put not forth my hands to touch the feast,

				 				She came to me and spake these winged words:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Why sittest thou like one who has no power

				 				Of speech, Ulysses, wrapt in thoughts that gnaw

				 				Thy heart, and tasting neither food nor wine?

				 				Still dost thou dream of fraud? It is not well

				 				That thou shouldst fear it longer, since I pledged

				 				Myself against it with a mighty oath.’



			 				“She spake, and I replied: ‘What man whose heart

				 				Is faithful could endure to taste of food

				 				Or wine till he should see his captive friends

				 				Once more at large? If with a kind intent

				 				Thou bidst me eat and drink, let me behold

				 				With mine own eyes my dear companions free.’



			 				“I spake; and Circè took her wand and went

				 				Forth from her halls, and, opening the gate

				 				That closed the sty, drove forth what seemed a herd

				 				Of swine in their ninth year. They ranged themselves

				 				Before her, and she went from each to each

				 				And shed on them another drug. Forthwith

				 				Fell from their limbs the bristles which had grown

				 				All over them, when mighty Circè gave

				 				At first the baleful potion. Now again

				 				My friends were men, and younger than before,

				 				And of a nobler mien and statelier growth.

				 				They knew me all; and each one pressed my hand

				 				In his, and there were tears and sobs of joy

				 				That sounded through the palace. Circè too

				 				Was moved, the mighty goddess; she drew near

				 				And stood by me, and spake these winged words:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Son of Laertes, nobly born and wise,

				 				Ulysses! go to thy good ship beside

				 				The sea and draw it up the beach, and hide

				 				The goods and weapons in the caverns there,

				 				And come thou back and bring with thee thy friends.’



			 				“She spake, and easily my generous mind

				 				Was moved by what she said. Forthwith I went

				 				To my good ship beside the sea, and found

				 				My friends in tears, lamenting bitterly.

				 				As in some grange the calves come leaping round

				 				A herd of kine returning to the stall

				 				From grassy fields where they have grazed their fill,

				 				Nor can the stall contain the young which spring

				 				Around their mothers with continual bleat;

				 				So when my comrades saw me through their tears,

				 				They sprang to meet me, and their joy was such

				 				As if they were in their own native land

				 				And their own city, on the rugged coast

				 				Of Ithaca, where they were born and reared;

				 				And as they wept they spake these winged words:﻿—



			 				“ ‘O foster-child of Jove! we welcome thee

				 				On thy return with a delight as great

				 				As if we all had reached again the land

				 				That gave us birth, our Ithaca. And now

				 				Tell by what death our other friends have died.’



			 				“They spake; I answered with consoling words:﻿—

				 				‘First draw our galley up the beach, and hide

				 				Our goods and all our weapons in the caves,

				 				And then let all make haste to follow me,

				 				And see our friends in Circè’s sacred halls,

				 				Eating and drinking at the plenteous board.’



			 				“I spake; and cheerfully my men obeyed,

				 				Save that Eurylochus alone essayed

				 				To hold them back, and spake these winged words:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Ah, whither are we going, wretched ones?

				 				Are ye so eager for an evil fate,

				 				That ye must go where Circè dwells, who waits

				 				To turn us into lions, swine, or wolves,

				 				Forced to remain and guard her spacious house?

				 				So was it with the Cyclops, when our friends

				 				Went with this daring chief to his abode,

				 				And perished there through his foolhardiness.’



			 				“He spake; and then I thought to draw my sword

				 				From my stout thigh, and with the trenchant blade

				 				Strike off his head and let it fall to earth,

				 				Though he were my near kinsman; yet the rest

				 				Restrained me, each one speaking kindly words:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Nay, foster-child of Jove! if thou consent,

				 				This man shall stay behind and with the ship,

				 				And he shall guard the ship, but lead us thou

				 				To where the sacred halls of Circè stand.’



			 				“They spake, and from the ship and shore went up

				 				Into the land, nor was Eurylochus

				 				Left with the ship; he followed, for he feared

				 				My terrible threat. Meantime had Circè bathed

				 				My comrades at the palace, and with oil

				 				Anointed them, and robed them in fair cloaks

				 				And tunics. There we found them banqueting.

				 				When they and those who came with me beheld

				 				Each other, and the memory of the past

				 				Came back to them, they wept abundantly,

				 				And all the palace echoed with their sobs.

				 				And then the mighty goddess came and said:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Son of Laertes, nobly born and wise,

				 				Prolong thou not these sorrows. Well I know

				 				What ye have suffered on the fishy deep,

				 				And all the evil that malignant men

				 				Have done to you on land. Now take the food

				 				Before you, drink the wine, till ye receive

				 				Into your hearts the courage that was yours

				 				When long ago ye left your fatherland,

				 				The rugged Ithaca. Ye are unnerved

				 				And spiritless with thinking constantly

				 				On your long wanderings, and your minds allow

				 				No space for mirth, for ye have suffered much.’



			 				“She spake; her words persuaded easily

				 				Our generous minds, and there from day to day

				 				We lingered a full year, and banqueted

				 				Nobly on plenteous meats and delicate wines.

				 				But when the year was ended, and the hours

				 				Renewed their circle, my beloved friends

				 				From Circè’s palace called me forth and said:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Good chief, do not forget thy native land,

				 				If fate indeed permit that ever thou

				 				Return in safety to that lofty pile

				 				Thy palace in the country of thy birth.’



			 				“So spake they, and my generous mind was moved.

				 				All that day long until the set of sun

				 				We sat and feasted on the abundant meats

				 				And delicate wines; and when the sun went down

				 				They took their rest within the darkened halls,

				 				While I to Circè’s sumptuous couch went up,

				 				A suppliant at her knees. The goddess heard

				 				My prayer, as thus in winged words I said:﻿—



			 				“ ‘O Circè! make, I pray, the promise good

				 				Which thou hast given, to send me to my home.

				 				My heart is pining for it, and the hearts

				 				Of all my friends, who weary out my life

				 				Lamenting round me when thou art not nigh.’



			 				“I spake; the mighty goddess thus replied:﻿—

				 				‘Son of Laertes, nobly born and wise,

				 				Ulysses! ye must not remain with me

				 				Unwillingly; but ye have yet to make

				 				Another voyage, and must visit first

				 				The abode of Pluto, and of Proserpine

				 				His dreaded queen, and there consult the soul

				 				Of the blind seer Tiresias﻿—him of Thebes﻿—

				 				Whose intellect was spared; for Proserpine

				 				Gave back to him in death the power of mind,

				 				That only he might know of things to come.

				 				The rest are shades that flit from place to place.’



			 				“Thus spake the goddess; and my heart was wrung

				 				With sorrow, and I sat upon the couch

				 				And wept, nor could I longer wish to live

				 				And see the light of day. But when my grief,

				 				With shedding tears and tossing where I sat,

				 				Was somewhat spent, I spake to Circè thus:﻿—



			 				“ ‘O Circè, who will guide me when I make

				 				This voyage? for no galley built by man

				 				Has ever yet arrived at Pluto’s realm.’



			 				“I spake; the mighty goddess answered me:﻿—

				 				‘Son of Laertes, nobly born and wise,

				 				Take thou no thought of who shall guide thy barque,

				 				But raise the mast and spread the glimmering sail,

				 				And seat thyself, and let the north-wind waft

				 				Thy galley on. As soon as thou shalt cross

				 				Océanus, and come to the low shore

				 				And groves of Proserpine, the lofty groups

				 				Of poplars, and the willows that let fall

				 				Their withered fruit, moor thou thy galley there

				 				In the deep eddies of Océanus,

				 				And pass to Pluto’s comfortless abode.

				 				There into Acheron are poured the streams

				 				Of Pyriphlegethon, and of that arm

				 				Of Styx, Cocytus. At the place where meet

				 				The ever-roaring waters stands a rock;

				 				Draw near to that, and there I bid thee scoop

				 				In earth a trench, a cubit long and wide.

				 				And round about it pour to all the dead

				 				Libations﻿—milk and honey first, and next

				 				Rich wine, and lastly water, scattering

				 				White meal upon them. Offer there thy prayer

				 				Fervently to that troop of airy forms,

				 				And make the vow that thou wilt sacrifice,

				 				When thou at last shalt come to Ithaca,

				 				A heifer without blemish, barren yet,

				 				In thine own courts, and heap the altar-pyre

				 				With things of price; and to the seer alone,

				 				Tiresias, by himself, a ram whose fleece

				 				Is wholly black, the best of all thy flocks.

				 				And after thou hast duly offered prayer

				 				To all the illustrious nations of the dead,

				 				Then sacrifice a ram and a black ewe,

				 				Their faces turned toward Erebus, but thine

				 				The other way and toward the river streams.

				 				Thither the souls of those who died will flock

				 				In multitudes. Then call thy friends, and give

				 				Command to flay in haste the sheep that lie

				 				Slain by the cruel brass, and, burning there

				 				The carcasses, pay worship to the gods﻿—

				 				The powerful Pluto and dread Proserpine.

				 				Draw then the sword upon thy thigh, and sit,

				 				And suffer none of all those airy forms

				 				To touch the blood until thou first bespeak

				 				Tiresias. He will come, and speedily﻿—

				 				The leader of the people﻿—and will tell

				 				What voyage thou must make, what length of way

				 				Thou yet must measure, and will show thee how

				 				Thou mayst return across the fishy deep.’



			 				“She spake; and while she spake the Morn looked forth

				 				Upon her golden throne. The Nymph bestowed

				 				On me a cloak and tunic, and arrayed

				 				Herself in a white robe with ample folds﻿—

				 				A delicate web and graceful. Round her loins

				 				She clasped a shining zone of gold, and hung

				 				A veil upon her forehead. Forth I went

				 				Throughout the palace and aroused my friends,

				 				And thus I said in cheerful tones to each:﻿—



			 				“ ‘No longer give yourselves to idle rest

				 				And pleasant slumber; we are to depart.

				 				The gracious Circè counsels us to go.’



			 				“I spake, and easily their generous minds

				 				Inclined to me. Yet brought I not away

				 				All my companions safely from the isle.

				 				Elpenor was the youngest of our band,

				 				Not brave in war was he, nor wise in thought.

				 				He, overcome with wine, and for the sake

				 				Of coolness, had lain down to sleep, apart

				 				From all the rest, in Circè’s sacred house;

				 				And as my friends bestirred themselves, the noise

				 				And tumult roused him; he forgot to come

				 				By the long staircase; headlong from the roof

				 				He plunged; his neck was broken at the spine,

				 				And his soul went to the abode of death.



			 				“My friends came round me, and I said to them:﻿—

				 				Haply your thought may be that you are bound

				 				For the dear country of your birth; but know

				 				That Circè sends us elsewhere, to consult

				 				The Theban seer, Tiresias, in the abode

				 				Of Pluto and the dreaded Proserpine.’



			 				“I spake, and their hearts failed them as they heard;

				 				They sat them down, and wept, and tore their hair,

				 				But fruitless were their sorrow and their tears.



			 				“Thus as we sadly moved to our good ship

				 				Upon the seashore, weeping all the while,

				 				Circè, meantime, had visited its deck,

				 				And there had bound a ram and a black ewe

				 				By means we saw not; for what eye discerns

				 				The presence of a deity, who moves

				 				From place to place, and wills not to be seen?”





						Book 						XI


					Visit of Ulysses to the Land of the Dead


				 				Voyage to the land of the dead﻿—Interview with Tiresias, the seer﻿—The heroes and heroines whom Ulysses saw there﻿—Interview with his mother, and with Agamemnon, Achilles, and others﻿—Occupations of the dead﻿—Punishments of the guilty.





				“Now, when we reached our galley by the shore,

				 				We drew it first into the mighty deep,

				 				And set the mast and sails, and led on board

				 				The sheep, and sorrowfully and in tears

				 				Embarked ourselves. The fair-haired and august

				 				Circè, expert in music, sent with us

				 				A kindly fellow-voyager﻿—a wind

				 				That breathed behind the dark-prowed barque, and swelled

				 				The sails; and now, with all things in their place

				 				Throughout the ship, we sat us down﻿—the breeze

				 				And helmsman guiding us upon our way.

				 				All day our sails were stretched, as o’er the deep

				 				Our vessel ran; the sun went down; the paths

				 				Of the great sea were darkened, and our barque

				 				Reached the far confines of Océanus.



			 				“There lies the land, and there the people dwell

				 				Of the Cimmerians, in eternal cloud

				 				And darkness. Never does the glorious sun

				 				Look on them with his rays, when he goes up

				 				Into the starry sky, nor when again

				 				He sinks from heaven to earth. Unwholesome night

				 				O’erhangs the wretched race. We touched the land,

				 				And, drawing up our galley on the beach,

				 				Took from on board the sheep, and followed on

				 				Beside the ocean-stream until we reached

				 				The place of which the goddess Circè spake.



			 				“Here Perimedes and Eurylochus

				 				Held in their grasp the victims, while I drew

				 				The trusty sword upon my thigh, and scooped

				 				A trench in earth, a cubit long and wide,

				 				Round which we stood, and poured to all the dead

				 				Libations﻿—milk and honey first, and next

				 				Rich wine, and lastly water, scattering

				 				White meal upon them. Then I offered prayer

				 				Fervently to that troop of airy forms,

				 				And made a vow that I would sacrifice,

				 				When I at last should come to Ithaca,

				 				A heifer without blemish, barren yet,

				 				In my own courts, and heap the altar-pyre

				 				With things of price, and to the seer alone,

				 				Tiresias, by himself, a ram whose fleece

				 				Was wholly black, the best of all my flocks.



			 				“When I had worshipped thus with praver and vows

				 				The nations of the dead, I took the sheep

				 				And pierced their throats above the hollow trench.

				 				The blood flowed dark; and thronging round me came

				 				Souls of the dead from Erebus﻿—young wives

				 				And maids unwedded, men worn out with years

				 				And toil, and virgins of a tender age

				 				In their new grief, and many a warrior slain

				 				In battle, mangled by the spear, and clad

				 				In bloody armor, who about the trench

				 				Flitted on every side, now here, now there,

				 				With gibbering cries, and I grew pale with fear.

				 				Then calling to my friends, I bade them flay

				 				The victims lying slaughtered by the knife,

				 				And, burning them with fire, invoke the gods﻿—

				 				The mighty Pluto and dread Proserpine.

				 				Then from my thigh I drew the trusty sword,

				 				And sat me down, and suffered none of all

				 				Those airy phantoms to approach the blood

				 				Until I should bespeak the Theban seer.



			 				“And first the soul of my companion came,

				 				Elpenor, for he was not buried yet

				 				In earth’s broad bosom. We had left him dead

				 				In Circè’s halls, unwept and unentombed.

				 				We had another task. But when I now

				 				Beheld I pitied him, and, shedding tears,

				 				I said these winged words: ‘How earnest thou,

				 				Elpenor, hither into these abodes

				 				Of night and darkness? Thou hast made more speed,

				 				Although on foot, than I in my good ship.’



			 				“I spake; the phantom sobbed and answered me:﻿—

				 				‘Son of Laertes, nobly born and wise,

				 				Ulysses! ’twas the evil doom decreed

				 				By some divinity, and too much wine,

				 				That wrought my death. I laid myself to sleep

				 				In Circè’s palace, and, remembering not

				 				The way to the long stairs that led below,

				 				Fell from the roof, and by the fall my neck

				 				Was broken at the spine; my soul went down

				 				To Hades. I conjure thee now, by those

				 				Whom thou hast left behind and far away,

				 				Thy consort and thy father﻿—him by whom

				 				Thou when a boy wert reared﻿—and by thy son

				 				Telemachus, who in thy palace-halls

				 				Is left alone﻿—for well I know that thou,

				 				In going hence from Pluto’s realm, wilt moor

				 				Thy gallant vessel in the Aeaean isle﻿—

				 				That there, O king, thou wilt remember me,

				 				And leave me not when thou departest thence

				 				Unwept, unburied, lest I bring on thee

				 				The anger of the gods. But burn me there

				 				With all the armor that I wore, and pile,

				 				Close to the hoary deep, a mound for me﻿—

				 				A hapless man of whom posterity

				 				Shall hear. Do this for me, and plant upright

				 				Upon my tomb the oar with which I rowed,

				 				While yet a living man, among thy friends.’



			 				“He spake and I replied: ‘Unhappy youth,

				 				All this I duly will perform for thee.’



			 				“And then the soul of Anticleia came﻿—

				 				My own dead mother, daughter of the king

				 				Autolycus, large-minded. Her I left

				 				Alive, what time I sailed for Troy, and now

				 				I wept to see her there, and pitied her,

				 				And yet forbade her, though with grief, to come

				 				Near to the blood till I should first accost

				 				Tiresias. He too came, the Theban seer,

				 				Tiresias, bearing in his hand a wand

				 				Of gold; he knew me and bespake me thus:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Why, O unhappy mortal, hast thou left

				 				The light of day to come among the dead

				 				And to this joyless land? Go from the trench

				 				And turn thy sword away, that I may drink

				 				The blood, and speak the word of prophecy.’



			 				“He spake; withdrawing from the trench, I thrust

				 				Into its sheath my silver-studded sword,

				 				And after drinking of the dark red blood

				 				The blameless prophet turned to me and said:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Illustrious chief Ulysses, thy desire

				 				Is for a happy passage to thy home,

				 				Yet will a god withstand thee. Not unmarked

				 				By Neptune shalt thou, as I deem, proceed

				 				Upon thy voyage. He hath laid up wrath

				 				Against thee in his heart, for that thy hand

				 				Deprived his son of sight. Yet may ye still

				 				Return, though after many hardships borne,

				 				If thou but hold thy appetite in check,

				 				And that of thy companions, when thou bring

				 				Thy gallant barque to the Trinacrian isle,

				 				Safe from the gloomy deep. There will ye find

				 				The beeves and fading wethers of the Sun﻿—

				 				The all-beholding and all-hearing Sun.

				 				If these ye leave unharmed, and keep in mind

				 				The thought of your return, ye may go back,

				 				Though sufferers, to your home in Ithaca;

				 				But if thou do them harm, the event will be

				 				Destruction to thy ship and to its crew;

				 				And thou, if thou escape it, wilt return

				 				Late to thy country, all thy comrades lost,

				 				And in a foreign barque, and thou shalt find

				 				Wrong in thy household﻿—arrogant men who waste

				 				Thy substance, wooers of thy noble wife,

				 				And offering bridal gifts. On thy return

				 				Thou shalt avenge thee of their violent deeds;

				 				And when thou shalt have slain them in thy halls,

				 				Whether by stratagem or by the sword

				 				In open fight, then take a shapely oar

				 				And journey on, until thou meet with men

				 				Who have not known the sea nor eaten food

				 				Seasoned with salt, nor ever have beheld

				 				Galleys with crimson prows, nor shapely oars,

				 				Which are the wings of ships. I will declare

				 				A sign by which to know them, nor canst thou

				 				Mistake it. When a traveller, meeting thee,

				 				Shalt say that thou dost bear a winnowing-fan

				 				Upon thy sturdy shoulder, stop and plant

				 				Thy shapely oar upright in earth, and there

				 				Pay to King Neptune solemn sacrifice﻿—

				 				A ram, a bull, and from his herd of swine

				 				A boar. And then returning to thy home,

				 				See that thou offer hallowed hecatombs

				 				To all the ever-living ones who dwell

				 				In the broad heaven, to each in order due.

				 				So at the last thy death shall come to thee

				 				Far from the sea, and gently take thee off

				 				In a serene old age that ends among

				 				A happy people. I have told thee true.’



			 				“He spake, and thus I answered him: ‘The gods,

				 				Tiresias, have decreed as thou hast said.

				 				But tell, and tell me truly﻿—I behold

				 				The soul of my dead mother; there she sits

				 				In silence by the blood, and will not deign

				 				To look upon her son nor speak to him.

				 				Instruct me, mighty prophet, by what means

				 				To make my mother know me for her son.’



			 				“I spake, and instantly the seer replied:﻿—

				 				‘Easily that is told; I give it thee

				 				To bear in mind. Whoever of the dead

				 				Thou sufferest to approach and drink the blood

				 				Will speak the truth; those whom thou dost forbid

				 				To taste the blood will silently withdraw.’



			 				“The soul of King Tiresias, saying this,

				 				Passed to the abode of Pluto; he had given

				 				The oracle I asked. I waited still

				 				Until my mother, drawing near again,

				 				Drank the dark blood; she knew me suddenly,

				 				And said in piteous tones these winged words:﻿—



			 				“ ‘How didst thou come, my child, a living man,

				 				Into this place of darkness? Difficult

				 				It is for those who breathe the breath of life

				 				To visit these abodes, through which are rolled

				 				Great rivers, fearful floods﻿—the first of these

				 				Océanus, whose waters none can cross

				 				On foot, or save on board a trusty barque.

				 				Hast thou come hither on thy way from Troy,

				 				A weary wanderer with thy ship and friends?

				 				And hast thou not been yet at Ithaca,

				 				Nor in thine island palace seen thy wife?’



			 				“She spake, I answered: ‘ ’Tis necessity,

				 				Dear mother, that has brought me to the abode

				 				Of Pluto, to consult the Theban seer,

				 				Tiresias. Not to the Achaian coast

				 				Have I returned, nor reached our country, yet

				 				Continually I wander; everywhere

				 				I meet misfortune﻿—even from the time

				 				When, in the noble Agamemnon’s train,

				 				I came to Ilium, famed for steeds, and made

				 				War on its dwellers. Tell me now, I pray,

				 				And truly, how it was that fate on thee

				 				Brought the long sleep of death? by slow disease?

				 				Or, stealing on thee, did the archer-queen,

				 				Diana, slay thee with her silent shafts?

				 				And tell me of my father, and the son

				 				Left in my palace. Rests the sway I bore

				 				On them, or has another taken it,

				 				Since men believe I shall return no more?

				 				And tell me of my wedded wife, her thoughts

				 				And purposes, and whether she remains

				 				Yet with my son. Is she the guardian still

				 				Of my estates, or has the noblest chief

				 				Of those Achaians led her thence a bride?’



			 				“I spake; my reverend mother answered thus:﻿—

				 				‘Most certain is it that she sadly dwells

				 				Still in thy palace. Weary days and nights

				 				And tears are hers. No man has taken yet

				 				Thy place as ruler, but Telemachus

				 				Still has the charge of thy domain, and gives

				 				The liberal feasts which it befits a prince

				 				To give, for all invite him. In the fields

				 				Thy father dwells, and never in the town

				 				Is seen; nor beds nor cloaks has he, nor mats

				 				Of rich device, but, all the winter through,

				 				He sleeps where sleep the laborers, on the hearth,

				 				Amid the dust, and wears a wretched garb;

				 				And when the summer comes, or autumn days

				 				Ripen the fruit, his bed is on the ground,

				 				And made of leaves, that everywhere are shed

				 				In the rich vineyards. There he lies and grieves,

				 				And, cherishing his sorrow, mourns thy fate,

				 				And keenly feels the miseries of age.

				 				And thus I underwent my fate and died;

				 				For not the goddess of the unerring bow

				 				Stealing upon me smote me in thy halls

				 				With silent arrows, nor did slow disease

				 				Come o’er me, such as, wasting cruelly

				 				The members, takes at last the life away;

				 				But constant longing for thee, anxious thoughts

				 				Of thee, and memory of thy gentleness,

				 				Ulysses, made an end of my sweet life.’



			 				“She spake; I longed to take into my arms

				 				The soul of my dead mother. Thrice I tried,

				 				Moved by a strong desire, and thrice the form

				 				Passed through them like a shadow or a dream.

				 				And then did the great sorrow in my heart

				 				Grow sharper, and in winged words I said:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Beloved mother, why wilt thou not keep

				 				Thy place, that I may clasp thee, so that here,

				 				In Pluto’s realm and in each other’s arms,

				 				We each might in the other soothe the sense

				 				Of misery? Hath mighty Proserpine

				 				Sent but an empty shade to meet me here,

				 				That I might only grieve and sigh the more?’



			 				“I spake, and then my reverend mother said:﻿—

				 				‘Believe not that Jove’s daughter Proserpine

				 				Deceives thee. ’Tis the lot of all our race

				 				When they are dead. No more the sinews bind

				 				The bones and flesh, when once from the white bones

				 				The life departs. Then like a dream the soul

				 				Flies off, and flits about from place to place.

				 				But haste thou to the light again, and mark

				 				What I have said, that thou in after days

				 				Mayst tell it to thy wife on thy return.’



			 				“Thus we conferred. Meantime the women came

				 				Around me, moved by mighty Proserpine;

				 				In throngs they gathered to the dark red blood.

				 				Then, as I pondered how to question each,

				 				This seemed the wisest﻿—from my sturdy thigh

				 				I plucked the trenchant sword, and suffered not

				 				All that were there to taste the blood at once;

				 				So one by one they came, and each in turn

				 				Declared her lineage. Thus I questioned all.



			 				“Then saw I highborn Tyro first, who claimed

				 				To be the daughter of that blameless man

				 				Salmoneus, and who called herself the wife

				 				Of Cretheus, son of Aeolus. She loved

				 				Enipeus, hallowed river, fairest stream

				 				Of all that flow on earth, and often walked

				 				Beside its pleasant waters. He whose arms

				 				Surround the islands, Neptune, once put on

				 				The river’s form, and at its gulfy mouth

				 				Met her; the purple waters stood upright

				 				Around them like a wall, and formed an arch,

				 				And hid the god and woman. There he loosed

				 				The virgin zone of Tyro, shedding sleep

				 				Upon her. Afterward he took her hand

				 				And said: ‘Rejoice, O maiden, in our love,

				 				For with the year’s return shalt thou bring forth

				 				Illustrious sons; the embraces of the gods

				 				Are not unfruitful. Rear them carefully.

				 				And now return to thy abode, and watch

				 				Thy words, and keep thy secret. Thou must know

				 				That I am Neptune, he who shakes the earth.’



			 				“He spake, and plunged into the billowy deep.

				 				And she became a mother, and brought forth

				 				Pelias and Neleus, valiant ministers

				 				Of mighty Jupiter. On the broad lands

				 				Of Iäolchos Pelias dwelt, and reared

				 				Vast flocks of sheep, while Neleus made his home

				 				In Pylos midst the sands. The queenly dame,

				 				His mother, meanwhile brought forth other sons

				 				To Cretheus﻿—Aeson first, and Pheres next,

				 				And Amythaon, great in horsemanship.



			 				“And after her I saw Antiopè,

				 				The daughter of Asopus﻿—her who made

				 				A boast that she had slumbered in the arms

				 				Of Jove. Two sons she bore﻿—Amphion one,

				 				The other Zethus﻿—and they founded Thebes

				 				With its seven gates, and girt it round with towers;

				 				For, valiant as they were, they could not dwell

				 				Safely in that great town unfenced by towers.



			 				“And after her I saw Amphitryon’s wife,

				 				Alcmena, her who brought forth Hercules,

				 				The dauntless hero of the lion-heart﻿—

				 				For she had given herself into the arms

				 				Of mighty Jupiter. I also saw

				 				Megara there, a daughter of the house

				 				Of laughty Creion. Her Amphitryon’s son,

				 				Unamable in strength, had made his wife.



			 				“The mother, too, of Oedipus I saw,

				 				Beautiful Epicastè, who in life

				 				Had done unwittingly a heinous deed﻿—

				 				Had married her own son, who, having slain

				 				Her father first, espoused her; but the gods

				 				Published abroad the rumor of the crime.

				 				He in the pleasant town of Thebes bore sway

				 				O’er the Cadmeians; yet in misery

				 				He lived, for so the offended gods ordained.

				 				And she went down to Hades and the gates

				 				That stand forever barred; for, wild with grief,

				 				She slung a cord upon a lofty beam

				 				And perished by it, leaving him to bear

				 				Woes without measure, such as on a son

				 				The furies of a mother might inflict.



			 				“And there I saw the dame supremely fair,

				 				Chloris, whom Neleus with large marriage-gifts

				 				Wooed, and brought home a bride; the youngest she

				 				Among the daughters of Iäsus’ son,

				 				Amphion, ruler o’er Orchomenus,

				 				The Minyeian town, and o’er the realm

				 				Of Pylos. Three illustrious sons she bore

				 				To Neleus﻿—Nestor, Chromius, and a chief

				 				Of lofty bearing, Periclymenus.

				 				She brought forth Pero also, marvellous

				 				In beauty, wooed by all the region round;

				 				but Neleus would bestow the maid on none

				 				Save him who should drive off from Phylacè

				 				The beeves, broad-fronted and with crooked horns,

				 				Of valiant Iphicles﻿—a difficult task.

				 				One man alone, a blameless prophet, dared

				 				Attempt it; but he found himself withstood

				 				By fate, and rigid fetters, and a force

				 				Of rustic herdsmen. Months and days went by,

				 				And the full year, led by the hours, came round.

				 				The valiant Iphicles, who from the seer

				 				Had heard the oracles explained, took off

				 				The shackles, and the will of Jove was done.



			 				“Then saw I Leda, wife of Tyndarus,

				 				Who bore to Tyndarus two noble sons,

				 				Castor the horseman, Pollux skilled to wield

				 				The cestus. Both of them have still a place

				 				Upon the fruitful earth; for Jupiter

				 				Gave them such honor that they live by turns

				 				Each one a day, and then are with the dead

				 				Each one by turns; they rank among the gods.



			 				“The wife of Aloëus next appeared,

				 				Iphidameia, who, as she declared,

				 				Had won the love of Neptune. She brought forth

				 				Two short-lived sons﻿—one like a god in form,

				 				Named Otus; and the other, far renowned,

				 				Named Ephialtes. These the bounteous earth

				 				Nourished to be the tallest of mankind,

				 				And goodliest, save Orion. When the twain

				 				Had seen but nine years of their life, they stood

				 				In breadth of frame nine cubits, and in height

				 				Nine fathoms. They against the living gods

				 				Threatened to wage, upon the Olympian height,

				 				Fierce and tumultuous battle, and to fling

				 				Ossa upon Olympus, and to pile

				 				Pelion, with all its growth of leafy woods,

				 				On Ossa, that the heavens might thus be scaled.

				 				And they, if they had reached their prime of youth,

				 				Had made their menace good. The son of Jove

				 				And amber-haired Latona took their lives

				 				Ere yet beneath their temples sprang the down

				 				And covered with its sprouting tufts the chin.



			 				“Phaedra I saw, and Procris, and the child

				 				Of the wise Minos, Ariadne, famed

				 				For beauty, whom the hero Theseus once

				 				From Crete to hallowed Athens’ fertile coast

				 				Led, but possessed her not. Diana gave

				 				Ear to the tale which Bacchus brought to her,

				 				And in the isle of Dia slew the maid.



			 				“And Maera I beheld, and Clymenè,

				 				And Eriphylè, hateful in her guilt,

				 				Who sold her husband for a price in gold.

				 				But vainly might I think to name them all﻿—

				 				The wives and daughters of heroic men

				 				Whom I beheld﻿—for first the ambrosial night

				 				Would wear away. And now for me the hour

				 				Of sleep is come, at my good ship among

				 				My friends, or haply here. Meantime the care

				 				For my return is with the gods and you.”



			 				He spake, and all were silent: all within

				 				The shadows of those palace-halls were held

				 				Motionless by the charm of what he said.

				 				And thus the white-armed Queen Aretè spake:﻿—



			 				“Phaeacians, how appears this man to you

				 				In form, in stature, and well-judging mind?

				 				My guest he is, but each among you shares

				 				The honor of the occasion. Now, I pray,

				 				Dismiss him not in haste, nor sparingly

				 				Bestow your gifts on one in so much need;

				 				For in your dwellings is much wealth, bestowed

				 				Upon you by the bounty of the gods.”



			 				Then also Echeneüs, aged chief,

				 				The oldest man of the Phaeacians, spake:﻿—



			 				“My friends, the word of our sagacious queen

				 				Errs not, nor is ill-timed, and yours it is

				 				To hearken and obey: but all depends

				 				Upon Alcinoüs﻿—both the word and deed.”



			 				And then in turn Alcinoüs spake: “That word

				 				Shall be fulfilled, if I am ruler here

				 				O’er the Phaeacians, skilled in seamanship.

				 				But let the stranger, though he long for home,

				 				Bear to remain till morning, that his store

				 				Of gifts may be complete. To send him home

				 				Shall be the charge of all, but mostly mine,

				 				Since mine it is to hold the sovereign power.”



			 				And then the wise Ulysses said: “O King

				 				Alcinoüs, eminent o’er all thy race!

				 				Shouldst thou command me to remain with thee

				 				Even for a twelvemonth, and at length provide

				 				For my return, and give me princely gifts,

				 				Even that would please me; for with fuller hands,

				 				The happier were my lot on my return

				 				To my own land. I should be honored then,

				 				And meet a kinder welcome there from all

				 				Who see me in my Ithaca once more.”



			 				And then again in turn Alcinoüs spake:﻿—

				 				“Ulysses, when we look on thee, we feel

				 				No fear that thou art false, or one of those,

				 				The many, whom the dark earth nourishes,

				 				Wandering at large, and forging lies, that we

				 				May not suspect them. Thou hast grace of speech

				 				And noble thoughts, and fitly hast thou told,

				 				Even as a minstrel might, the history

				 				Of all thy Argive brethren and thy own.

				 				Now say, and frankly, didst thou also see

				 				Any of those heroic men who went

				 				With thee to Troy, and in that region met

				 				Their fate? A night immeasurably long

				 				Is yet before us. Let us have thy tale

				 				Of wonders. I could listen till the break

				 				Of hallowed morning, if thou canst endure

				 				So long to speak of hardships thou hast borne.”



			 				He spake, and wise Ulysses answered thus:﻿—

				 				“O King Alcinoüs, eminent beyond

				 				All others of thy people. For discourse

				 				There is a time; there is a time for sleep.

				 				If more thou yet wouldst hear, I will not spare

				 				To give the story of the greater woes

				 				Of my companions, who were afterward

				 				Cut off from life; and though they had escaped

				 				The cruel Trojan war, on their return

				 				They perished by a woman’s fraud and guilt.



			 				“When chaste Proserpina had made the ghosts

				 				Of women scatter right and left, there came

				 				The soul of Agamemnon, Atreus’ son.

				 				He came attended by a throng of those

				 				Who in the palace of Aegisthus met

				 				A fate like his and died. When he had drunk

				 				The dark red blood, he knew me at a look,

				 				And wailed aloud, and, bursting into tears,

				 				Stretched out his hands to touch me; but no power

				 				Was there of grasp or pressure, such as once

				 				Dwelt in those active limbs. I could not help

				 				But weep at sight of him, for from my heart

				 				I pitied him, and spake these winged words:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Most glorious son of Atreus, king of men!

				 				How, Agamemnon, has the fate that brings

				 				To man the everlasting sleep of death

				 				O’ertaken thee? Did Neptune, calling up

				 				The winds in all their fury, make thy fleet

				 				A wreck, or did thine enemies on land

				 				Smite thee, as thou wert driving off their beeves

				 				And their fair flocks, or fighting to defend

				 				Some city, and the helpless women there?’



			 				“I spake, and Agamemnon thus replied:﻿—

				 				‘Son of Laertes, nobly born and wise,

				 				’Twas not that Neptune calling up the winds

				 				In all their fury wrecked me in my fleet,

				 				Nor hostile warriors smote me on the land,

				 				But that Aegisthus, bent upon my death,

				 				Plotted against me with my guilty wife,

				 				And bade me to his house and slew me there,

				 				Even at the banquet, as a hind might slay

				 				A bullock at the stall. With me they slew

				 				My comrades, as a herd of white-toothed swine

				 				Are slaughtered for some man of large estates,

				 				Who makes a wedding or a solemn feast.

				 				Thou hast seen many perish by the sword

				 				In the hard battle, one by one, and yet

				 				Thou wouldst have pitied us, hadst thou beheld

				 				The slain beside the wine-jar, and beneath

				 				The loaded tables, while the pavement swam

				 				With blood. I heard Cassandra’s piteous cry,

				 				The cry of Priam’s daughter, stricken down

				 				By treacherous Clytemnestra at my side.

				 				And there I lay, and, dying, raised my hands

				 				To grasp my sword. The shameless woman went

				 				Her way, nor stayed to close my eyes, nor press

				 				My mouth into its place, although my soul

				 				Was on its way to Hades. There is naught

				 				That lives more horrible, more lost to shame,

				 				Than is the woman who has brought her mind

				 				To compass deeds like these﻿—the wretch who plans

				 				So foul a crime﻿—the murder of the man

				 				Whom she a virgin wedded. I had looked

				 				For a warm welcome from my children here,

				 				And all my household in my ancient home.

				 				This woman, deep in wickedness, hath brought

				 				Disgrace upon herself and all her sex,

				 				Even those who give their thoughts to doing good.’



			 				“He spake, and I replied: ‘O, how the God

				 				Who wields the thunder, Jupiter, must hate

				 				The house of Atreus for the women’s sake!

				 				At first we fell by myriads in the cause

				 				Of Helen; Clytemnestra now hath planned

				 				This guile against thee while thou wert afar.’



			 				“I spake, and instantly his answer came:﻿—

				 				‘Therefore be not compliant to thy wife,

				 				Nor let her hear from thee whatever lies

				 				Within thy knowledge. Tell her but a part,

				 				And keep the rest concealed. Yet is thy life,

				 				Ulysses, in no danger from thy spouse;

				 				For wise and well instructed in the rules

				 				Of virtuous conduct is Penelope,

				 				The daughter of Icarius. When we went

				 				To war, we left her a young bride; a babe

				 				Was at her breast, a boy, who now must sit

				 				Among grown men; and fortunate is he,

				 				For certainly his father will behold

				 				The youth on his return, and he embrace

				 				His father, as is meet. But as for me,

				 				My consort suffered not my eyes to feed

				 				Upon the sight of my own son; for first

				 				She slew me. This, then, I admonish thee﻿—

				 				Heed thou my words. Bring not thy ship to land

				 				Openly in thy country, but by stealth,

				 				Since now no longer can we put our trust

				 				In woman. Meantime, tell me of my son,

				 				And faithfully, if thou hast heard of him

				 				As living, whether in Orchomenus,

				 				Or sandy Pylos, or in the broad realm

				 				Of Menelaus, Sparta; for not yet

				 				Has my Orestes passed from earth and life.’



			 				“He spake, and I replied: ‘Why ask of me

				 				That question, O Atrides? I know not

				 				Whether thy son be living or be dead,

				 				And this is not a time for idle words.’



			 				“Thus in sad talk we stood, and freely flowed

				 				Our tears. Meanwhile the ghosts of Peleus’ son

				 				Achilles, and Patroclus, excellent

				 				Antilochus, and Ajax, all drew near﻿—

				 				Ajax for form and stature eminent

				 				O’er all the Greeks save Peleus’ faultless son.

				 				Then did the soul of fleet Aeacides

				 				Know me, and thus in winged words he said:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Ulysses! what hath moved thee to attempt

				 				This greatest of thy labors? How is it

				 				That thou hast found the courage to descend

				 				To Hades, where the dead, the bodiless forms

				 				Of those whose work is done on earth, abide?’



			 				“He spake; I answered: ‘Greatest of the Greeks!

				 				Achilles, son of Peleus! ’Twas to hear

				 				The counsel of Tiresias that I came,

				 				If haply he might tell me by what means

				 				To reach my rugged Ithaca again;

				 				For yet have I not trod my native coast,

				 				Nor even have drawn nigh to Greece. I meet

				 				Misfortunes everywhere. But as for thee,

				 				Achilles, no man lived before thy time,

				 				Nor will hereafter live, more fortunate

				 				Than thou﻿—for while alive we honored thee

				 				As if thou wert a god, and now again

				 				In these abodes thou rulest o’er the dead;

				 				Therefore, Achilles, shouldst thou not be sad.’



			 				“I spake; Achilles quickly answered me:﻿—

				 				‘Noble Ulysses, speak not thus of death,

				 				As if thou couldst console me. I would be

				 				A laborer on earth, and serve for hire

				 				Some man of mean estate, who makes scant cheer,

				 				Rather than reign o’er all who have gone down

				 				To death. Speak rather of my noble son,

				 				Whether or not he yet has joined the wars

				 				To fight among the foremost of the host.

				 				And tell me also if thou aught hast heard

				 				Of blameless Peleus﻿—whether he be yet

				 				Honored among his many Myrmidons,

				 				Or do they hold him now in small esteem

				 				In Hellas and in Phthia, since old age

				 				Unnerves his hands and feet, and I no more

				 				Am there, beneath the sun, to give him aid,

				 				Strong as I was on the wide plain of Troy,

				 				When warring for the Achaian cause I smote

				 				That valiant people. Could I come again,

				 				But for a moment, with my former strength,

				 				Into my father’s palace, I would make

				 				That strength and these unconquerable hands

				 				A terror to the men who do him wrong,

				 				And rob him of the honor due a king.’



			 				“He spake; I answered: ‘Nothing have I heard

				 				Of blameless Peleus, but I will relate

				 				The truth concerning Neoptolemus,

				 				Thy son, as thou requirest. Him I took

				 				From Scyros in a gallant barque to join

				 				The well-armed Greeks. Know, then, that when we sat

				 				In council, planning to conduct the war

				 				Against the city of Troy, he always rose

				 				The first to speak, nor were his words unwise.

				 				The godlike Nestor and myself alone

				 				Rivalled him in debate. And when we fought

				 				About the city walls, he loitered not

				 				Among the others in the numerous host,

				 				But hastened on before them, giving place

				 				To no man there in valor. Many men

				 				He slew in desperate combat, whom to name

				 				Were past my power, so many were they all

				 				Whom in the cause of Greece he struck to earth.

				 				Yet one I name, Eurypylus, the son

				 				Of Telephus, who perished by his sword

				 				With many of his band, Citeians, led

				 				To war because of liberal gifts bestowed

				 				Upon their chieftain’s wife; the noblest he

				 				Of men, in form, whom I have ever seen,

				 				Save Memnon. When into the wooden steed,

				 				Framed by Epeius, we the chiefs of Greece

				 				Ascended, and to me was given the charge

				 				Of all things there, to open and to shut

				 				The close-built fraud, while others of high rank

				 				Among the Greeks were wiping off their tears,

				 				And their limbs shook, I never saw thy son

				 				Turn pale in his fine face, or brush away

				 				A tear, but he besought me earnestly

				 				That he might leave our hiding-place, and grasped

				 				His falchion’s hilt, and lifted up his spear

				 				Heavy with brass, for in his mind he smote

				 				The Trojan crowd already. When at last

				 				We had o’erthrown and sacked the lofty town

				 				Of Priam, he embarked upon a ship,

				 				With all his share of spoil﻿—a large reward﻿—

				 				Unhurt, not touched in combat hand to hand,

				 				Nor wounded from afar, as oftentimes

				 				Must be the fortune of a fight, for Mars

				 				Is wont to rage without regard to men.’



			 				“I spake. The soul of swift Aeacides

				 				Over the meadows thick with asphodel

				 				Departed with long strides, well pleased to hear

				 				From me the story of his son’s renown.



			 				“The other ghosts of those who lay in death

				 				Stood sorrowing by, and each one told his griefs;

				 				But that of Ajax, son of Telamon,

				 				Kept far aloof, displeased that I had won

				 				The victory contending at the fleet

				 				Which should possess the arms of Peleus’ son.

				 				His goddess-mother laid them as a prize

				 				Before us, and the captive sons of Troy

				 				And Pallas were the umpires to award

				 				The victory. And now how much I wish

				 				I had not conquered in a strife like that,

				 				Since for that cause the dark earth hath received

				 				The hero Ajax, who in nobleness

				 				Of form and greatness of exploits excelled

				 				All other Greeks, except the blameless son

				 				Of Peleus. Then I spake in soothing words:﻿—



			 				“ ‘O Ajax, son of blameless Telamon!

				 				Wilt thou not even in death forget the wrath

				 				Caused by the strife for those accursed arms?

				 				The gods have made them fatal to the Greeks,

				 				For thou, the bulwark of our host, didst fall,

				 				And we lamented thee as bitterly

				 				When thou wert dead as we had mourned the son

				 				Of Peleus. Nor was any man to blame;

				 				’Twas Jupiter who held in vehement hate

				 				The army of the warlike Greeks, and laid

				 				This doom upon thee. Now, O king, draw near,

				 				And hear our voice and words, and check, I pray,

				 				The anger rising in thy generous breast.’



			 				“I spake; he answered not, but moved away

				 				To Erebus, among the other souls

				 				Of the departed. Yet would I have had

				 				Speech of him, angry as he was, or else

				 				Have spoken to him further, but my wish

				 				Was strong to see yet others of the dead.



			 				“Then I beheld the illustrious son of Jove,

				 				Minos, a golden sceptre in his hand,

				 				Sitting to judge the dead, who round the king

				 				Pleaded their causes. There they stood or sat

				 				In Pluto’s halls﻿—a pile with ample gates.



			 				“And next I saw the huge Orion drive,

				 				Across the meadows green with asphodel,

				 				The savage beast whom he had slain; he bore

				 				The brazen mace, which no man’s power could break.



			 				“And Tityus there I saw﻿—the mighty earth

				 				His mother﻿—overspreading, as he lay,

				 				Nine acres, with two vultures at his side,

				 				That, plucking at his liver, plunged their beaks

				 				Into the flesh; nor did his hands avail

				 				To drive them off, for he had offered force

				 				To Jove’s proud wife Latona, as she went

				 				To Pytho, through the pleasant Panopeus.



			 				“And next I looked on Tantalus, a prey

				 				To grievous torments, standing in a lake

				 				That reached his chin. Though painfully athirst,

				 				He could not drink; as often as he bowed

				 				His aged head to take into his lips

				 				The water, it was drawn away, and sank

				 				Into the earth, and the dark soil appeared

				 				Around his feet; a god had dried it up.

				 				And lofty trees drooped o’er him, hung with fruit﻿—

				 				Pears and pomegranates, apples fair to sight,

				 				And luscious figs, and olives green of hue.

				 				And when that ancient man put forth his hands

				 				To pluck them from their stems, the wind arose

				 				And whirled them far among the shadowy clouds.



			 				“There I beheld the shade of Sisyphus

				 				Amid his sufferings. With both hands he rolled

				 				A huge stone up a hill. To force it up,

				 				He leaned against the mass with hands and feet;

				 				But, ere it crossed the summit of the hill

				 				A power was felt that sent it rolling back,

				 				And downward plunged the unmanageable rock

				 				Before him to the plain. Again he toiled

				 				To heave it upward, while the sweat in streams

				 				Ran down his limbs, and dust begrimed his brow.



			 				“Then I beheld the mighty Hercules﻿—

				 				The hero’s image﻿—for he sits himself

				 				Among the deathless gods, well pleased to share

				 				Their feasts, and Hebe of the dainty feet﻿—

				 				A daughter of the mighty Jupiter

				 				And golden-sandalled Juno﻿—is his wife.

				 				Around his image flitted to and fro

				 				The ghosts with noise, like fear-bewildered birds.

				 				His look was dark as night. He held in hand

				 				A naked bow, a shaft upon the string,

				 				And fiercely gazed, like one about to send

				 				The arrow forth. Upon his breast he wore

				 				The formidable baldric, on whose band

				 				Of gold were sculptured marvels﻿—forms of bears,

				 				Wild boars, grim lions, battles, skirmishings,

				 				And death by wounds, and slaughter. He who wrought

				 				That band had never done the like before,

				 				Nor could thereafter. As I met his eye,

				 				The hero knew me, and, beholding me

				 				With pity, said to me in winged words:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Son of Laertes, nobly born and wise,

				 				And yet unhappy; surely thou dost bear

				 				A cruel fate, like that which I endured

				 				While yet I saw the brightness of the sun.

				 				The offspring of Saturnian Jupiter

				 				Am I, and yet was I compelled to serve

				 				One of a meaner race than I, who set

				 				Difficult tasks. He sent me hither once

				 				To bring away the guardian hound; he deemed

				 				No harder task might be. I brought him hence,

				 				I led him up from Hades, with such aid

				 				As Hermes and the blue-eyed Pallas gave.’



			 				“Thus having spoken, he withdrew again

				 				Into the abode of Pluto. I remained

				 				And kept my place, in hope there yet might come

				 				Heroes who perished in the early time,

				 				And haply I might look on some of those﻿—

				 				The ancients, whom I greatly longed to see﻿—

				 				On Theseus and Pirithoüs, glorious men,

				 				The children of the gods. But now there flocked

				 				Already round me, with a mighty noise,

				 				The innumerable nations of the dead;

				 				And I grew pale with fear, lest from the halls

				 				Of Pluto the stern Proserpine should send

				 				The frightful visage of the monster-maid,

				 				The Gorgon. Hastening to my ship, I bade

				 				The crew embark, and cast the hawsers loose.

				 				Quickly they went on board, and took their seats

				 				Upon the benches. Through Océanus

				 				The current bore my galley, aided first

				 				By oars and then by favorable gales.”





						Book 						XII


					The Sirens, Scylla, and Charybdis


				 				Return of Ulysses to the island of Circè﻿—Her counsels respecting his homeward voyage﻿—The sirens﻿—Escape from Scylla and Charybdis﻿—His arrival at Trinacria﻿—Slaughter of the oxen of the Sun by his companions﻿—A tempest, in consequence, by which his companions all perish, and he only escapes by swimming to the island of Calypso.





				“Now when our barque had left Océanus

				 				And entered the great deep, we reached the isle

				 				Aeaea, where the Morning, child of Dawn,

				 				Abides, and holds her dances, and the Sun

				 				Goes up from earth. We landed there and drew

				 				Our galley up the beach; we disembarked

				 				And laid us down to sleep beside the sea,

				 				And waited for the holy Morn to rise.



			 				“Then when the rosy-fingered Morn appeared,

				 				The child of Dawn, I sent my comrades forth

				 				To bring from Circè’s halls Elpenor’s corse.

				 				And where a headland stretched into the deep

				 				We hewed down trees, and held the funeral rites

				 				With many tears; and having there consumed

				 				The body and the arms with fire, we built

				 				A tomb, and reared a column to the dead,

				 				And on its summit fixed a tapering oar.



			 				“All this was duly done; yet was the news

				 				Of our return from Hades not concealed

				 				From Circè. She attired herself in haste

				 				And came; her maids came with her, bringing bread

				 				And store of meats and generous wine; and thus

				 				Spake the wise goddess, standing in the midst:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Ah, daring ones! who, yet alive, have gone

				 				Down to the abode of Pluto; twice to die

				 				Is yours, while others die but once. Yet now

				 				Take food, drink wine, and hold a feast today,

				 				And with the dawn of morning ye shall sail;

				 				And I will show the way, and teach you all

				 				Its dangers, so that ye may not lament

				 				False counsels followed, either on the land

				 				Or on the water, to your grievous harm.’



			 				“She spake, and our confiding minds were swayed

				 				Easily by her counsels. All that day

				 				Till set of sun we sat and banqueted

				 				Upon the abundant meats and generous wines;

				 				And when the Sun went down, and darkness came,

				 				The crew beside the fastenings of our barque

				 				Lay down to sleep, while Circè took my hand,

				 				Led me apart, and made me sit, and took

				 				Her seat before me, and inquired of all

				 				That I had seen. I told her faithfully,

				 				And then the mighty goddess Circè said:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Thus far is well; now needfully attend

				 				To what I say, and may some deity

				 				Help thee remember it! Thou first wilt come

				 				To where the Sirens haunt. They throw a spell

				 				O’er all who pass that way. If unawares

				 				One finds himself so nigh that he can hear

				 				Their voices, round him nevermore shall wife

				 				And lisping children gather, welcoming

				 				His safe return with joy. The Sirens sit

				 				In a green field, and charm with mellow notes

				 				The comer, while beside them lie in heaps

				 				The bones of men decaying underneath

				 				The shrivelled skins. Take heed and pass them by.

				 				First fill with wax well kneaded in the palm

				 				The ears of thy companions, that no sound

				 				May enter. Hear the music, if thou wilt,

				 				But let thy people bind thee, hand and foot,

				 				To the good ship, upright against the mast,

				 				And round it wind the cord, that thou mayst hear

				 				The ravishing notes. But shouldst thou then entreat

				 				Thy men, commanding them to set thee free,

				 				Let them be charged to bind thee yet more fast

				 				With added bands. And when they shall have passed

				 				The Sirens by, I will not judge for thee

				 				Which way to take; consider for thyself;

				 				I tell thee of two ways. There is a pile

				 				Of beetling rocks, where roars the mighty surge

				 				Of dark-eyed Amphitritè; these are called

				 				The Wanderers by the blessed gods. No birds

				 				Can pass them safe, not even the timid doves,

				 				Which bear ambrosia to our father Jove,

				 				But ever doth the slippery rock take off

				 				Someone, whose loss the God at once supplies,

				 				To keep their number full. To these no barque

				 				Guided by man has ever come, and left

				 				The spot unwrecked; the billows of the deep

				 				And storms of fire in air have scattered wide

				 				Timbers of ships and bodies of drowned men.

				 				One only of the barques that plough the deep

				 				Has passed them safely﻿—Argo, known to all

				 				By fame, when coming from Aeaeta home﻿—

				 				And her the billows would have dashed against

				 				The enormous rocks, if Juno, for the sake

				 				Of Jason, had not come to guide it through.



			 				“ ‘Two are the rocks; one lifts to the broad heaven

				 				Its pointed summit, where a dark gray cloud

				 				Broods, and withdraws not; never is the sky

				 				Clear o’er that peak, not even in summer days

				 				Or autumn; nor can man ascend its steeps,

				 				Or venture down﻿—so smooth the sides, as if

				 				Man’s art had polished them. There in the midst

				 				Upon the western side toward Erebus

				 				There yawns a shadowy cavern; thither thou,

				 				Noble Ulysses, steer thy barque, yet keep

				 				So far aloof that, standing on the deck,

				 				A youth might send an arrow from a bow

				 				Just to the cavern’s mouth. There Scylla dwells,

				 				And fills the air with fearful yells; her voice

				 				The cry of whelps just littered, but herself

				 				A frightful prodigy﻿—a sight which none

				 				Would care to look on, though he were a god.

				 				Twelve feet are hers, all shapeless; six long necks,

				 				A hideous head on each, and triple rows

				 				Of teeth, close set and many, threatening death.

				 				And half her form is in the cavern’s womb,

				 				And forth from that dark gulf her heads are thrust,

				 				To look abroad upon the rocks for prey﻿—

				 				Dolphin, or dogfish, or the mightier whale,

				 				Such as the murmuring Amphitritè breeds

				 				In multitudes. No mariner can boast

				 				That he has passed by Scylla with a crew

				 				Unharmed; she snatches from the deck, and bears

				 				Away in each grim mouth, a living man.



			 				“ ‘Another rock, Ulysses, thou wilt see,

				 				Of lower height, so near her that a spear,

				 				Cast by the hand, might reach it. On it grows

				 				A huge wild fig-tree with luxuriant leaves.

				 				Below, Charybdis, of immortal birth,

				 				Draws the dark water down; for thrice a day

				 				She gives it forth, and thrice with fearful whirl

				 				She draws it in. O, be it not thy lot

				 				To come while the dark water rushes down!

				 				Even Neptune could not then deliver thee.

				 				Then turn thy course with speed toward Scylla’s rock,

				 				And pass that way; ’twere better far that six

				 				Should perish from the ship than all be lost’



			 				“She spake, and I replied: ‘O goddess, deign

				 				To tell me truly, cannot I at once

				 				Escape Charybdis and defend my friends

				 				Against the rage of Scylla when she strikes?’



			 				“I spake; the mighty goddess answered me:﻿—

				 				‘Rash man! dost thou still think of warlike deeds,

				 				And feats of strength? And wilt thou not give way

				 				Even to the deathless gods? That pest is not

				 				Of mortal mould; she cannot die, she is

				 				A thing to tremble and to shudder at,

				 				And fierce, and never to be overcome.

				 				There is no room for courage; flight is best.

				 				And if thou shouldst delay beside the rock

				 				To take up arms, I fear lest once again

				 				She fall on thee with all her heads, and seize

				 				As many men. Pass by the monster’s haunt

				 				With all the speed that thou canst make, and call

				 				Upon Crataeis, who brought Scylla forth

				 				To be the plague of men, and who will calm

				 				Her rage, that she assault thee not again.



			 				“ ‘Then in thy voyage shalt thou reach the isle

				 				Trinacria, where, in pastures of the Sun,

				 				His many beeves and fading sheep are fed﻿—

				 				Seven herds of oxen, and as many flocks

				 				Of sheep, and fifty in each flock and herd.

				 				They never multiply; they never die.

				 				Two shepherdesses tend them, goddesses,

				 				Nymphs with redundant locks﻿—Lampelia one,

				 				The other Phaëthusa. These the nymph

				 				Naeëra to the overgoing Sun

				 				Brought forth, and when their queenly mother’s care

				 				Had reared them, she appointed them to dwell

				 				In far Trinacria, there to keep the flocks

				 				And oxen of their father. If thy thoughts

				 				Be fixed on thy return, so that thou leave

				 				These flocks and herds unharmed, ye all will come

				 				To Ithaca, though after many toils.

				 				But if thou rashly harm them, I foretell

				 				Destruction to thy ship and all its crew;

				 				And if thyself escape, thou wilt return

				 				Late and in sorrow, all thy comrades lost.’



			 				“She spake; the Morning on her golden throne

				 				Looked forth; the glorious goddess went her way

				 				Into the isle, I to my ship, and bade

				 				The men embark and cast the hawsers loose.

				 				And straight they went on board, and duly manned

				 				The benches, smiting as they sat with oars

				 				The hoary waters. Circè, amber-haired,

				 				The mighty goddess of the musical voice,

				 				Sent a fair wind behind our dark-prowed ship

				 				That gayly bore us company, and filled

				 				The sails. When we had fairly ordered all

				 				On board our galley, we sat down, and left

				 				The favoring wind and helm to bear us on,

				 				And thus in sadness I bespake the crew:﻿—



			 				“ ‘My friends! it were not well that one or two

				 				Alone should know the oracles I heard

				 				From Circè, great among the goddesses;

				 				And now will I disclose them, that ye all,

				 				Whether we are to die or to escape

				 				The doom of death, may be forewarned. And first

				 				Against the wicked Sirens and their song

				 				And flowery bank she warns us. I alone

				 				May hear their voice, but ye must bind me first

				 				With bands too strong to break, that I may stand

				 				Upright against the mast; and let the cords

				 				Be fastened round it. If I then entreat

				 				And bid you loose me, make the bands more strong.’



			 				“Thus to my crew I spake, and told them all

				 				That they should know, while our good ship drew near

				 				The island of the Sirens, prosperous gales

				 				Wafting it gently onward. Then the breeze

				 				Sank to a breathless calm; some deity

				 				Had hushed the winds to slumber. Straightway rose

				 				The men and furled the sails and laid them down

				 				Within the ship, and sat and made the sea

				 				White with the beating of their polished blades,

				 				Made of the fir-tree. Then I took a mass

				 				Of wax and cut it into many parts,

				 				And kneaded each with a strong hand. It grew

				 				Warm with the pressure, and the beams of him

				 				Who journeys round the earth, the monarch Sun.

				 				With this I filled the ears of all my men

				 				From first to last. They bound me, in their turn,

				 				Upright against the mast-tree, hand and foot,

				 				And tied the cords around it. Then again

				 				They sat and threshed with oars the hoary deep.

				 				And when, in running rapidly, we came

				 				So near the Sirens as to hear a voice

				 				From where they sat, our galley flew not by

				 				Unseen by them, and sweetly thus they sang:﻿—



			 				“ ‘O world-renowned Ulysses! thou who art

				 				The glory of the Achaians, turn thy barque

				 				Landward, that thou mayst listen to our lay

				 				No man has passed us in his galley yet,

				 				Ere he has heard our warbled melodies.

				 				He goes delighted hence a wiser man;

				 				For all that in the spacious realm of Troy

				 				The Greeks and Trojans by the will of Heaven

				 				Endured we know, and all that comes to pass

				 				In all the nations of the fruitful earth.’ ”



			 				’Twas thus they sang, and sweet the strain. I longed

				 				To listen, and with nods I gave the sign

				 				To set me free; they only plied their oars

				 				The faster. Then upsprang Eurylochus

				 				And Perimedes, and with added cords

				 				Bound me, and drew the others still more tight.

				 				And when we now had passed the spot, and heard

				 				No more the melody the Sirens sang,

				 				My comrades hastened from their ears to take

				 				The wax, and loosed the cords and set me free.



			 				“As soon as we had left the isle, I saw

				 				Mist and a mountain billow, and I heard

				 				The thunder of the waters. From the hands

				 				Of my affrighted comrades flew the oars,

				 				The deep was all in uproar; but the ship

				 				Stopped there, for all the rowers ceased their task.

				 				I went through all the ship exhorting them

				 				With cheerful words, man after man, and said:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Reflect, my friends, that we are not untried

				 				In evil fortunes, nor in sadder plight

				 				Are we than when within his spacious cave

				 				The brutal Cyclops held us prisoners;

				 				Yet through my valor we escaped, and through

				 				My counsels and devices, and I think

				 				That ye will live to bear this day’s events

				 				In memory like those. Now let us act.

				 				Do all as I advise; go to your seats

				 				Upon the benches, smiting with your oars

				 				These mighty waves, and haply Jove will grant

				 				That we escape the death which threatens us.

				 				Thee, helmsman, I adjure﻿—and heed my words,

				 				Since to thy hands alone is given in charge

				 				Our gallant vessel’s rudder﻿—steer thou hence

				 				From mist and tumbling waves, and well observe

				 				The rock, lest where it juts into the sea

				 				Thou heed it not, and bring us all to wreck.’



			 				“I spake, and quickly all obeyed my words.

				 				Yet said I naught of Scylla﻿—whom we now

				 				Could not avoid﻿—lest all the crew in fear

				 				Should cease to row, and crowd into the hold.

				 				And then did I forget the stern command

				 				Which Circè gave me, not to arm myself

				 				For combat. In my shining arms I cased

				 				My limbs, and took in hand two ponderous spears,

				 				And went on deck, and stood upon the prow﻿—

				 				For there it seemed to me that Scylla first

				 				Would show herself﻿—that monster of the rocks﻿—

				 				To seize my comrades. Yet I saw her not,

				 				Though weary grew my eyes with looking long

				 				And eagerly upon those dusky cliffs.



			 				“Sadly we sailed into the strait, where stood

				 				On one hand Scylla, and the dreaded rock

				 				Charybdis on the other, drawing down

				 				Into her horrid gulf the briny flood;

				 				And as she threw it forth again, it tossed

				 				And murmured as upon a glowing fire

				 				The water in a cauldron, while the spray,

				 				Thrown upward, fell on both the summit-rocks;

				 				And when once more she swallowed the salt sea,

				 				It whirled within the abyss, while far below

				 				The bottom of blue sand was seen. My men

				 				Grew pale with fear; we looked into the gulf

				 				And thought our end was nigh. Then Scylla snatched

				 				Six of my comrades from our hollow barque,

				 				The best in valor and in strength of arm.

				 				I looked to my good ship; I looked to them,

				 				And saw their hands and feet still swung in air

				 				Above me, while for the last time on earth

				 				They called my name in agony of heart.

				 				As when an angler on a jutting rock

				 				Sits with his taper rod, and casts his bait

				 				To snare the smaller fish, he sends the horn

				 				Of a wild bull that guards his line afar

				 				Into the water, and jerks out a fish,

				 				And throws it gasping shoreward; so were they

				 				Uplifted gasping to the rocks, and there

				 				Scylla devoured them at her cavern’s mouth,

				 				Stretching their hands to me with piercing cries

				 				Of anguish. ’Twas in truth the saddest sight,

				 				Whatever I have suffered and where’er

				 				Have roamed the waters, that mine eyes have seen.



			 				“Escaping thus the rocks, the dreaded haunt

				 				Of Scylla and Charybdis, we approached

				 				The pleasant island of the Sun, where grazed

				 				The oxen with broad foreheads, beautiful,

				 				And flocks of sheep, the fatlings of the god

				 				Who makes the round of heaven. While yet at sea

				 				I heard from my black ship the low of herds

				 				In stables, and the bleatings of the flocks,

				 				And straightway came into my thought the words

				 				Of the blind seer Tiresias, him of Thebes,

				 				And of Aeaean Circè, who had oft

				 				Warned me to shun the island of the god

				 				Whose light is sweet to all. And then I said

				 				To my companions with a sorrowing heart:﻿—



			 				“ ‘My comrades, sufferers as ye are, give ear.

				 				I shall disclose the oracles which late

				 				Tiresias and Aeaean Circè gave.

				 				The goddess earnestly admonished me

				 				Not to approach the island of the Sun,

				 				Whose light is sweet to all, for there she said

				 				Some great misfortune lay in wait for us.

				 				Now let us speed the ship and pass the isle.’



			 				“I spake; their hearts were broken as they heard,

				 				And bitterly Eurylochus replied:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Austere art thou, Ulysses; thou art strong

				 				Exceedingly; no labor tires thy limbs;

				 				They must be made of iron, since thy will

				 				Denies thy comrades, overcome with toil

				 				And sleeplessness, to tread the land again,

				 				And in that isle amid the waters make

				 				A generous banquet. Thou wouldst have us sail

				 				Into the swiftly coming night, and stray

				 				Far from the island, through the misty sea.

				 				By night spring up the mighty winds that make

				 				A wreck of ships, and how can one escape

				 				Destruction, should a sudden hurricane

				 				Rise from the south or the hard-blowing west,

				 				Such as, in spite of all the sovereign gods,

				 				Will cause a ship to founder in the deep?

				 				Let us obey the dark-browed Night, and take

				 				Our evening meal, remaining close beside

				 				Our gallant barque, and go on board again

				 				When morning breaks, and enter the wide sea.’



			 				“So spake Eurylochus; the rest approved.

				 				And then I knew that some divinity

				 				Was meditating evil to our band,

				 				And I bespake him thus in winged words:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Eurylochus, ye force me to your will,

				 				Since I am only one. Now all of you

				 				Bind yourselves to me firmly, by an oath,

				 				That if ye haply here shall meet a herd

				 				Of beeves or flock of sheep, ye will not dare

				 				To slay a single ox or sheep, but feed

				 				Contented on the stores that Circè gave.’



			 				“I spake, and readily my comrades swore

				 				As I required; and when that solemn oath

				 				Was taken, to the land we brought and moored

				 				Our galley in a winding creek, beside

				 				A fountain of sweet water. From the deck

				 				Stepped my companions and made ready there

				 				Their evening cheer. They ate and drank till thirst

				 				And hunger were appeased, and then they thought

				 				Of those whom Scylla from our galley’s deck

				 				Snatched and devoured; they thought and wept till sleep

				 				Stole softly over them amid their tears.

				 				Now came the third part of the night; the stars

				 				Were sinking when the Cloud-compeller Jove

				 				Sent forth a violent wind with eddying gusts,

				 				And covered both the earth and sky with clouds,

				 				And darkness fell from heaven. When Morning came,

				 				The rosy-fingered daughter of the Dawn,

				 				We drew the ship into a spacious grot.

				 				There were the seats of nymphs, and there we saw

				 				The smooth fair places where they danced. I called

				 				A council of my men, and said to them:﻿—



			 				“ ‘My friends, in our good ship are food and drink;

				 				Abstain we from these beeves, lest we be made

				 				To suffer; for these herds and these fair flocks

				 				Are sacred to a dreaded god, the Sun﻿—

				 				The all-beholding and all-hearing Sun.’



			 				“I spake, and all were swayed by what I said

				 				Full easily. A month entire the gales

				 				Blew from the south, and after that no wind

				 				Save east and south. While yet we had our bread

				 				And ruddy wine, my comrades spared the beeves,

				 				Moved by the love of life. But when the stores

				 				On board our galley were consumed, they roamed

				 				The island in their need, and sought for prey,

				 				And snared with barbed hooks the fish and birds﻿—

				 				Whatever came to hand﻿—till they were gaunt

				 				With famine. Meantime I withdrew alone

				 				Into the isle, to supplicate the gods,

				 				If haply one of them might yet reveal

				 				The way of my return. As thus I strayed

				 				Into the land, apart from all the rest,

				 				I found a sheltered nook where no wind came,

				 				And prayed with washen hands to all the gods

				 				Who dwell in heaven. At length they bathed my lids

				 				In a soft sleep. Meantime, Eurylochus

				 				With fatal counsels thus harangued my men:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Hear, my companions, sufferers as ye are,

				 				The words that I shall speak. All modes of death

				 				Are hateful to the wretched race of men;

				 				But this of hunger, thus to meet our fate,

				 				Is the most fearful. Let us drive apart

				 				The best of all the oxen of the Sun,

				 				And sacrifice them to the immortal ones

				 				Who dwell in the broad heaven. And if we come

				 				To Ithaca, our country, we will there

				 				Build to the Sun, whose path is o’er our heads,

				 				A sumptuous temple, and endow its shrine

				 				With many gifts and rare. But if it be

				 				His will, approved by all the other gods,

				 				To sink our barque in anger, for the sake

				 				Of these his high-horned oxen, I should choose

				 				Sooner to gasp my life away amid

				 				The billows of the deep, than pine to death

				 				By famine in this melancholy isle.’



			 				“So spake Eurylochus; the crew approved.

				 				Then from the neighboring herd they drove the best

				 				Of all the beeves; for near the dark-prowed ship

				 				The fair broad-fronted herd with crooked horns

				 				Were feeding. Round the victims stood my crew,

				 				And, offering their petitions to the gods,

				 				Held tender oak-leaves in their hands, just plucked

				 				From a tall tree, for in our good ship’s hold

				 				Was no white barley now. When they had prayed,

				 				And slain and dressed the beeves, they hewed away

				 				The thighs and covered them with double folds

				 				Of caul, and laid raw slices over these.

				 				Wine had they not to pour in sacrifice

				 				Upon the burning flesh; they poured instead

				 				Water, and roasted all the entrails thus.

				 				Now when the thighs were thoroughly consumed,

				 				And entrails tasted, all the rest was carved

				 				Into small portions, and transfixed with spits.



			 				“Just then the gentle slumber left my lids.

				 				I hurried to the shore and my good ship,

				 				And, drawing near, perceived the savory steam

				 				From the burnt-offering. Sorrowfully then

				 				I called upon the ever-living gods:﻿—



			 				“ ‘O Father Jove, and all ye blessed gods,

				 				Who live forever, ’twas a cruel sleep

				 				In which ye lulled me to my grievous harm;

				 				My comrades here have done a fearful wrong.’



			 				“Lampetia, of the trailing robes, in haste

				 				Flew to the Sun, who journeys round the earth,

				 				To tell him that my crew had slain his beeves,

				 				And thus in anger he bespake the gods:﻿—



			 				“ ‘O Father Jove, and all ye blessed gods

				 				Who never die, avenge the wrong I bear

				 				Upon the comrades of Laertes’ son,

				 				Ulysses, who have foully slain my beeves,

				 				In which I took delight whene’er I rose

				 				Into the starry heaven, and when again

				 				I sank from heaven to earth. If for the wrong

				 				They make not large amends, I shall go down

				 				To Hades, there to shine among the dead.’



			 				“The cloud-compelling Jupiter replied:﻿—

				 				‘Still shine, O Sun! among the deathless gods

				 				And mortal men, upon the nourishing earth.

				 				Soon will I cleave, with a white thunderbolt,

				 				Their galley in the midst of the black sea.’



			 				“This from Calypso of the radiant hair

				 				I heard thereafter; she herself, she said,

				 				Had heard it from the herald Mercury.



			 				“When to the ship I came, beside the sea,

				 				I sternly chid them all, man after man,

				 				Yet could we think of no redress; the beeves

				 				Were dead; and now with prodigies the gods

				 				Amazed my comrades﻿—the skins moved and crawled,

				 				The flesh both raw and roasted on the spits

				 				Lowed with the voice of oxen. Six whole days

				 				My comrades feasted, taking from the herd

				 				The Sun’s best oxen. When Saturnian Jove

				 				Brought the seventh day, the tempest ceased; the wind

				 				Fell, and we straightway went on board. We set

				 				The mast upright, and, spreading the white sails,

				 				We ventured on the great wide sea again.



			 				“When we had left the isle, and now appeared

				 				No other land, but only sea and sky,

				 				The son of Saturn caused a lurid cloud

				 				To gather o’er the galley, and to cast

				 				Its darkness on the deep. Not long our ship

				 				Ran onward, ere the furious west-wind rose

				 				And blew a hurricane. A strong blast snapped

				 				Both ropes that held the mast; the mast fell back;

				 				The tackle dropped entangled to the hold;

				 				The mast, in falling on the galley’s stern,

				 				Dashed on the pilot’s head and crushed the bones,

				 				And from the deck he plunged like one who dives

				 				Into the deep; his gallant spirit left

				 				The limbs at once. Jove thundered from on high,

				 				And sent a thunderbolt into the ship,

				 				That, quaking with the fearful blow, and filled

				 				With stifling sulphur, shook my comrades off

				 				Into the deep. They floated round the ship

				 				Like seamews; Jupiter had cut them off

				 				From their return. I moved from place to place,

				 				Still in the ship, until the tempest’s force

				 				Parted the sides and keel. Before the waves

				 				The naked keel was swept. The mast had snapped

				 				Just at the base, but round it was a thong

				 				Made of a bullock’s hide; with this I bound

				 				The mast and keel together, took my seat

				 				Upon them, and the wild winds bore me on.



			 				“The west-wind ceased to rage; but in its stead

				 				The south-wind blew, and brought me bitter grief.

				 				I feared lest I must measure back my way

				 				To grim Charybdis. All night long I rode

				 				The waves, and with the rising sun drew near

				 				The rock of Scylla and the terrible

				 				Charybdis as her gulf was drawing down

				 				The waves of the salt sea. There as I came

				 				I raised myself on high till I could grasp

				 				The lofty fig-tree, and I clung to it

				 				As clings a bat﻿—for I could neither find

				 				A place to plant my feet, nor could I climb,

				 				So distant were the roots, so far apart

				 				The long huge branches overshadowing

				 				Charybdis. Yet I firmly kept my hold

				 				Till she should throw the keel and mast again

				 				Up from the gulf. They, as I waited long,

				 				Came up again, though late﻿—as late as one

				 				Who long has sat adjudging strifes between

				 				Young suitors pleading in the marketplace

				 				Rises and goes to take his evening meal;

				 				So late the timbers of my barque returned,

				 				Thrown from Charybdis. Then I dropped amid

				 				The dashing waves, and came with hands and feet

				 				On those long timbers in the midst, that they

				 				Might bear my weight. I sat on them and rowed

				 				With both my hands. The father of the gods

				 				And mortals suffered not that I should look

				 				On Scylla’s rock again, else had I not

				 				Escaped a cruel death. For nine long days

				 				I floated on the waters; on the tenth

				 				The gods at nightfall bore me to an isle﻿—

				 				Ogygia, where Calypso, amber-haired,

				 				A mighty goddess, skilled in song, abides,

				 				Who kindly welcomed me, and cherished me.

				 				Why should I speak of this? Here in these halls

				 				I gave the history yesterday to thee

				 				And to thy gracious consort, and I hate

				 				To tell again a tale once fully told.”

					Arrival of Ulysses at Ithaca


				 				Departure of Ulysses from the court of Alcinoüs﻿—Arrival of the ship at Ithaca﻿—Ulysses carried on shore by the Phaeacians while asleep, and left﻿—His treasures landed also﻿—The ship, while returning, transformed by Neptune into a rock﻿—Dialogue between Pallas and Ulysses concerning the destruction of the suitors﻿—Concealment of the treasures in a cave﻿—Transformation of Ulysses into an old man.





				He spake, and all within those shadowy halls

				 				Were silent; all were held in mute delight.

				 				Alcinoüs then took up the word and said:﻿—



			 				“Since thou hast come, Ulysses, as a guest,

				 				To this high pile and to these brazen rooms,

				 				So long a sufferer, thou must not depart

				 				Upon thy homeward way a wanderer still.

				 				And this let me enjoin on each of you

				 				Who in this palace drink at our repasts

				 				The choice red wine, and listen to the bard:

				 				Already in a polished chest are laid

				 				Changes of raiment, works of art in gold,

				 				And other gifts, which the Phaeacian chiefs

				 				Have destined for our guest; now let us each

				 				Bestow an ample tripod and a vase,

				 				And we in an assembly of the realm

				 				Will see the cost repaid, since otherwise

				 				Great would the burden be that each must bear.”

				 				So spake Alcinoüs; they approved, and sought

				 				Their homes to sleep, but when the child of Dawn,

				 				The rosy-fingered Morn, appeared, they came,

				 				All bringing to the ship their gifts of brass

				 				In honor of the guest. The mighty prince

				 				Alcinoüs, going through the ship, bestowed

				 				The whole beneath the benches, that no one

				 				Of those who leaned to pull the oar might thence

				 				Meet harm or hindrance. Then they all went back

				 				To the king’s palace, and prepared a feast.



			 				The mighty prince Alcinoüs offered up

				 				For them an ox to cloud-compelling Jove,

				 				The son of Saturn, ruler over all.

				 				They burned the thighs, and held high festival,

				 				And all was mirth. Divine Demodocus

				 				The bard, whom all men reverenced, sang to them.

				 				Meantime Ulysses often turned to look

				 				At the bright Sun, and longed to see him set,

				 				So eager was the hero to set sail

				 				Upon his homeward way. As when a swain

				 				Awaits his evening meal, for whom all day

				 				Two dark-brown steers have dragged the solid plough

				 				Through fallow grounds, and welcome is the hour

				 				Of sunset, calling him to his repast,

				 				And wearily he walks with failing knees,

				 				So welcome to Ulysses did the light

				 				Of day go down. Then did he hold discourse

				 				With the Phaeacians, lovers of the sea,

				 				And chiefly with Alcinoüs, speaking thus:﻿—



			 				“O monarch most illustrious of thy race,

				 				Alcinoüs, now when ye have duly poured

				 				Wine to the gods, be pleased to send me hence

				 				In peace, and fare ye well! All that my heart

				 				Could wish have ye provided bounteously﻿—

				 				An escort and rich gifts; and may the gods

				 				Bestow their blessing with them! May I meet

				 				My blameless wife again, and find my friends

				 				Prosperous! And ye whom I shall leave behind,

				 				Long may ye make the wives of your young years

				 				And children happy! May the gods vouchsafe

				 				To crown with every virtue you and them,

				 				And may no evil light upon your isle!”



			 				He spake; the assembly all approved his words,

				 				And bade send forth the stranger on his way,

				 				Who spake so nobly. Then the mighty prince

				 				Alcinoüs turned, and to the herald said:﻿—



			 				“Now mix the wine, Pontonoüs, in a jar,

				 				And bear a part to all beneath our roof,

				 				That we with prayers to Father Jupiter

				 				May send the stranger to his native land.”



			 				He spake; Pontonoüs mingled for the guests

				 				The generous wine, and went with it to each,

				 				Who poured it on the ground, from where they sat,

				 				To all the dwellers of the ample heaven;

				 				And then the great Ulysses, rising up,

				 				Placed the round goblet in Aretè’s hands,

				 				And thus bespake the queen with winged words:﻿—



			 				“Farewell, O queen, through the long years, till age

				 				And death, which are the lot of all, shall come.

				 				Now I depart, but mayst thou, here among

				 				Thy people, and the children of thy love,

				 				And King Alcinoüs, lead a happy life!”



			 				So spake the highborn chieftain, and withdrew,

				 				And crossed the threshold. King Alcinoüs sent

				 				A herald with him to direct his way

				 				To the fleet ship and border of the deep.

				 				Aretè also sent her servant-maids﻿—

				 				One bearing a fresh cloak and tunic, one

				 				A coffer nobly wrought, and yet a third

				 				Bread and red wine; and when they reached the ship

				 				Beside the sea, the diligent crew received

				 				Their burdens, and bestowed within the hold

				 				The food and drink, but spread upon the deck

				 				And at the stern a mat and linen sheet,

				 				That there Ulysses undisturbed might sleep.

				 				He went on board and silently lay down,

				 				While all the rowers in due order took

				 				Their seats upon the benches. Loosing first

				 				The hawser from the perforated rock,

				 				They bent them to their task, and flung the brine

				 				Up from the oar, while on the chieftain’s lids

				 				Lighted a sweet and deep and quiet sleep,

				 				Most like to death. As, smitten by the lash,

				 				Four harnessed stallions spring on high and dart

				 				Across the plain together; so the prow

				 				Rose leaping forward, while behind it rolled

				 				A huge dark billow of the roaring sea.

				 				Safely and steadily the galley ran,

				 				Nor could a falcon, swiftest of the birds,

				 				Have kept beside it, with such speed it flew,

				 				Bearing a hero who was like the gods

				 				In wisdom, and whose sufferings in the wars

				 				And voyages among the furious waves

				 				Were great and many, though he slumbered now

				 				In peace, forgetful of misfortunes past.



			 				Now when that brightest star, the harbinger

				 				Of Morning, daughter of the Dawn, arose,

				 				The barque had passed the sea, and reached the isle.



			 				A port there is in Ithaca, the haunt

				 				Of Phorcys, Ancient of the Sea. Steep shores

				 				Stretch inward toward each other, and roll back

				 				The mighty surges which the hoarse winds hurl

				 				Against them from the ocean, while within

				 				Ships ride without their hawsers when they once

				 				Have passed the haven’s mouth. An olive-tree

				 				With spreading branches at the farther end

				 				Of that fair haven stands, and overbrows

				 				A pleasant shady grotto of the nymphs

				 				Called Naiads. Cups and jars of stone are ranged

				 				Within, and bees lay up their honey there.

				 				There from their spindles wrought of stone the nymphs

				 				Weave their sea-purple robes, which all behold

				 				With wonder; there are ever-flowing springs.

				 				Two are the entrances: one toward the north

				 				By which men enter; but a holier one

				 				Looks toward the south, nor ever mortal foot

				 				May enter there. By that way pass the gods.



			 				They touched the land, for well they knew the spot.

				 				The galley, urged so strongly by the arms

				 				Of those who plied the oar, ran up the beach

				 				Quite half her length. And then the crew came forth

				 				From the good ship, and first they lifted out

				 				Ulysses with the linen and rich folds

				 				Of tapestry, and laid him on the sands

				 				In a deep slumber. Then they also took

				 				The presents from the hold, which, as he left

				 				Their isle, the princes of Phaeacia gave

				 				By counsel of wise Pallas. These they piled

				 				Close to the olive-tree, without the way,

				 				That none, in passing, ere Ulysses woke,

				 				Might do their owner wrong. Then homeward sailed

				 				The crew; but Neptune, who could not forge

				 				The threats which he had uttered long before

				 				Against the godlike chief Ulysses, thus

				 				Sought to explore the will of Jupiter:﻿—



			 				“O Father Jove! I shall no more be held

				 				In honor with the gods, since mortal men,

				 				The people of Phaeacia, though their race

				 				Is of my lineage, do not honor me.

				 				I meant Ulysses should not reach his home

				 				Save with much suffering, though I never thoyght

				 				To hinder his return, for thou hadst given

				 				Thy promise and thy nod that it should be.

				 				Yet these Phaeacians, in a gallant barque,

				 				Have borne him o’er the deep, and while he slept,

				 				Have laid him down in Ithaca, and given

				 				Large gifts, abundant store of brass and gold,

				 				And woven work, more than he could have brought

				 				From captured Ilium, if he had returned

				 				Safely, with all his portion of the spoil.”



			 				Then cloud-compelling Jupiter replied:

				 				“Earth-shaker, ruler of a mighty realm!

				 				What hast thou said? The gods deny thee not

				 				Due honor; perilous it were for them

				 				To show contempt for one who stands in age

				 				And might above them all. But if among

				 				The sons of men be one who puts such trust

				 				In his own strength as not to honor thee,

				 				Do as seems good to thee, and as thou wilt.”



			 				Promptly the god who shakes the shores replied;

				 				“What thou dost bid me I would do at once,

				 				But that I fear and would avoid thy wrath.

				 				I would destroy that fair Phaeacian barque

				 				In its return across the misty sea

				 				From bearing home Ulysses, that no more

				 				May the Phaeacians lend an escort thus

				 				To wandering men, and I would also cause

				 				A lofty mount to rise and hide their town.”



			 				Then spake again the Cloud-compeller Jove:

				 				“Thus were it best, my brother: when the crowd

				 				Of citizens already see the ship

				 				Approaching, then transform it to a rock

				 				In semblance of a galley, that they all

				 				May gaze in wonder; thus wilt thou have caused

				 				A lofty mount to stand before their town.”



			 				This when the shaker of the shores had heard,

				 				He flew to Scheria, the Phaeacian isle,

				 				And stood, until that galley, having crossed

				 				The sea, came swiftly scudding. He drew near

				 				And smote it with his open palm, and made

				 				The ship a rock, fast rooted in the bed

				 				Of the deep sea, and then he went his way.



			 				Then winged words were spoken in that throng

				 				Of the Phaeacians, wielders of long oars,

				 				And far renowned in feats of seamanship.

				 				And, looking on each other, thus they said:﻿—



			 				“Ha! what has stayed our good ship on the sea?

				 				This moment we beheld her hastening home.”



			 				’Twas thus they talked, unweeting of the cause.

				 				But then Alcinoüs to the assembly said:﻿—



			 				“Yes! now I call to mind the ancient words

				 				Of prophecy﻿—my father’s﻿—who was wont

				 				To say that Neptune sorely is displeased

				 				That we should give to every man who comes

				 				Safe escort to his home. In coming times﻿—

				 				Such was my father’s prophecy﻿—the god

				 				Would yet destroy a well-appointed barque

				 				Of the Phaeacians on the misty deep

				 				Returning from an escort, and would cause

				 				A lofty mount to stand before our town.

				 				So prophesied the aged man; his words

				 				Are here fulfilled. Now do as I appoint,

				 				And let us all obey. Henceforth refrain

				 				From bearing to their homes the strangers thrown

				 				Upon our coast; and let us sacrifice

				 				To Neptune twelve choice bullocks of the herd,

				 				That he may pity us, nor hide our town

				 				With a huge mountain from the sight of men.”



			 				He spake, and they were awed and straightway brought

				 				The bullocks for the sacrifice. So prayed

				 				To sovereign Neptune the Phaeacian chiefs

				 				And princes, standing round the altar-fires.



			 				Now woke the great Ulysses from his sleep

				 				In his own land, and yet he knew it not.

				 				Long had he been away, and Pallas now,

				 				The goddess-child of Jove, had cast a mist

				 				Around him, that he might not yet be known

				 				To others, and that she might tell him first

				 				What he should learn; nor even might his wife,

				 				Nor friends, nor people, know of his return,

				 				Ere he avenged upon the suitor crew

				 				His wrongs, and therefore all things wore to him

				 				Another look﻿—the footways stretching far,

				 				The bights where ships were moored, the towering rocks,

				 				And spreading trees. He rose and stood upright,

				 				And gazed upon his native coast and wept,

				 				And smote his thigh, and said in bitter grief:﻿—



			 				“Ah me! what region am I in, among

				 				What people? lawless, cruel, and unjust?

				 				Or are they hospitable men, who fear

				 				The gods? And where shall I bestow these goods,

				 				And whither go myself? Would that they all

				 				Were still with the Phaeacians, and that I

				 				Had found some other great and mighty king

				 				Kindly to welcome me, and send me back

				 				To my own land. I know not where to place

				 				These treasures, and I must not leave them here,

				 				Lest others come and seize them as a spoil.

				 				Nay, these Phaeacian chiefs and counsellors

				 				Were not, in all things, either wise or just.

				 				They gave their word to land me on the coast

				 				Of pleasant Ithaca, and have not kept

				 				Their promise. O, may Jove avenge this wrong!

				 				He who protects the suppliant, who beholds

				 				All men with equal eye, and punishes

				 				The guilty. Now will I review my stores

				 				And number them again, that I may see

				 				If those who left me here have taken aught.”



			 				Thus having said, he numbered all his gifts﻿—

				 				Beautiful tripods, cauldrons, works of gold,

				 				And gorgeous woven raiment; none of these

				 				Were wanting. Then he pined to see again

				 				His native isle, and slowly paced the beach

				 				Of the loud sea, lamenting bitterly.

				 				There Pallas came to meet him in the shape

				 				Of a young shepherd, delicately formed,

				 				As are the sons of kings. A mantle lay

				 				Upon her shoulder in rich folds; her feet

				 				Shone in their sandals: in her hand she bore

				 				A javelin. As Ulysses saw, his heart

				 				Was glad within him, and he hastened on,

				 				And thus accosted her with winged words:﻿—



			 				“Fair youth, who art the first whom I have met

				 				Upon this shore, I bid thee hail, and hope

				 				Thou meetest me with no unkind intent.

				 				Protect what thou beholdest here and me;

				 				I make my suit to thee as to a god,

				 				And come to thy dear knees. And tell, I pray,

				 				That I may know the truth, what land is this?

				 				What people? who the dwellers? may it be

				 				A pleasant isle, or is it but the shore

				 				Of fruitful mainland shelving to the sea?”



			 				And then the goddess, blue-eyed Pallas, said:

				 				“Of simple mind art thou, unless perchance

				 				Thou comest from afar, if thou dost ask

				 				What country this may be. It is not quite

				 				A nameless region; many know it well

				 				Of those who dwell beneath the rising sun,

				 				And those, behind, in Evening’s dusky realm.

				 				Rugged it is, and suited ill to steeds,

				 				Yet barren it is not, though level grounds

				 				Are none within its borders. It is rich

				 				In corn and wine, for seasonable rains

				 				And dews refresh its soil. Large flocks of goats

				 				And herds of beeves are pastured here; all kinds

				 				Of trees are in its forests, and its springs

				 				Are never dry. The fame of Ithaca,

				 				Stranger, has travelled to the Trojan coast,

				 				Though that, I hear, lies far away from Greece.”



			 				She spake; Ulysses, the great sufferer,

				 				Rejoiced to be in his own land, whose name

				 				Pallas, the child of aegis-bearing Jove,

				 				Had just now uttered. Then with winged words

				 				He spake, but not the truth; his artful speech

				 				Put that aside, forever in his breast

				 				The power of shrewd invention was awake:﻿—



			 				“In the broad fields of Crete, that lie far off

				 				Beyond the sea, I heard of Ithaca,

				 				To which I now am come with these my goods.

				 				I left as many for my sons and fled,

				 				For I had slain Orsilochus, the fleet

				 				Of foot, the dear son of Idomeneus,

				 				Who overcame by swiftness in the race

				 				The foremost runners in the realm of Crete.

				 				He sought to rob me wholly of my share

				 				Of Trojan spoil, for which I had endured

				 				Hardships in war with heroes, and at sea

				 				Among the angry waves. The cause was this:

				 				I would not in the siege of Troy submit

				 				To serve his father, but, apart from him,

				 				I led a troop, companions of my own.

				 				The youth returning from the fields I met,

				 				And smote him with the spear﻿—for near the way

				 				I lay in ambush with a single friend.

				 				A night exceeding dark was in the sky;

				 				No human eye beheld, nor did he know

				 				Who took his life. When I had slain him thus

				 				With the sharp spear I hastened to a ship

				 				Of the Phoenicians, and besought their aid,

				 				And gave them large reward, and bade them steer

				 				To Pylos, bearing me, and leave me there,

				 				Or where the Epeians hold the hallowed coast

				 				Of Elis. But the force of adverse winds

				 				Drove them unwilling thence; they meant no fraud.

				 				We wandered hither, just at night we came;

				 				And rowing hard, the seamen brought their ship

				 				Within the port. No word was said of food,

				 				Though great our need. All disembarked in haste

				 				And lay upon the shore. Deep was the sleep

				 				That stole upon my weary limbs. The men

				 				Took from the hold my goods, and, bearing them

				 				To where I slumbered on the sand, set sail

				 				For populous Sidonia, leaving me

				 				Here quite alone with sorrow in my heart.”



			 				He spake; the blue-eyed goddess, Pallas, smiled,

				 				And touched the chief caressingly. She seemed

				 				A beautiful and stately woman now,

				 				Such as are skilled in works of rare device,

				 				And thus she said to him in winged words:﻿—



			 				“Full shrewd were he, a master of deceit,

				 				Who should surpass thee in the ways of craft,

				 				Even though he were a god﻿—thou unabashed

				 				And prompt with shifts, and measureless in wiles!

				 				Thou canst not even in thine own land refrain

				 				From artful figments and misleading words,

				 				As thou hast practised from thy birth. But now

				 				Speak we of other matters, for we both

				 				Are skilled in stratagem. Thou art the first

				 				Of living men in counsel and in speech,

				 				And I am famed for foresight and for craft

				 				Among the immortals. Dost thou not yet know

				 				Pallas Athenè, child of Jove, whose aid

				 				Is present to defend thee in all time

				 				Of peril, and but lately gained for thee

				 				The favor of the whole Phaeacian race?

				 				And hither am I come to frame for thee

				 				Wise counsels, and to hide away the stores

				 				Given by the opulent Phaeacian chiefs

				 				At thy departure. I shall also tell

				 				What thou must yet endure beneath the roof

				 				Of thine own palace, by the will of fate.

				 				Yet bear it bravely, since thou must, nor speak

				 				To any man or woman of thyself

				 				And of thy wandering hither, but submit

				 				To many things that grieve thee, silently,

				 				And bear indignities from violent men.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, thus rejoined:

				 				“O goddess, it is hard for mortal man

				 				To know thee when he meets thee, though his sight

				 				Be of the sharpest, for thou puttest on

				 				At pleasure any form. Yet this I know,

				 				That thou wert kind to me when we, the sons

				 				Of Greece, were warring in the realm of Troy.

				 				But when we had o’erihrown the lofty town

				 				Of Priam, and embarked, and when some god

				 				Had scattered the Achaians, after that,

				 				Daughter of Jove, I never saw thee more,

				 				Never perceived thee entering my barque

				 				And guarding me from danger﻿—but I roamed

				 				Ever from place to place, my heart weighed down

				 				By sorrow, till the gods delivered me,

				 				And till thy counsels in the opulent realm

				 				Of the Phaeacians brought my courage back,

				 				And thou thyself didst guide me to the town.

				 				And now in thy great father’s name I pray﻿—

				 				For yet I cannot think that I am come

				 				To pleasant Ithaca, but have been thrown

				 				Upon some other coast, and fear that thou

				 				Art jesting with me, and hast spoken thus

				 				But to deceive me﻿—tell me, is it true

				 				That I am in my own beloved land?”



			 				And then the goddess, blue-eyed Pallas, said:

				 				“Such ever are thy thoughts, and therefore I

				 				Must not forsake thee in thy need. I know

				 				How prompt thy speech, how quick thy thought, how shrewd

				 				Thy judgment. If another man had come

				 				From such long wanderings, he had flown at once

				 				Delighted to his children and his wife

				 				In his own home. But thou desirest not

				 				To ask or hear of them till thou hast put

				 				Thy consort to the trial of her truth﻿—

				 				Her who now sits within thy halls and waits

				 				In vain for thee, and in perpetual grief

				 				And weeping wears her nights and days away.

				 				I never doubted﻿—well, in truth, I knew

				 				That thou, with all thy comrades lost, wouldst reach

				 				Thy country, but I dreaded to withstand

				 				My father’s brother Neptune, who was wroth,

				 				And fiercely wroth, for that thou hadst deprived

				 				His well-beloved son of sight. But now

				 				Attend, and I will show thee Ithaca

				 				By certain tokens; mark them and believe.

				 				The port of Phorcys, Ancient of the Deep,

				 				Is here; and there the spreading olive-tree,

				 				Just at the haven’s head; and, close beside,

				 				The cool dark grotto, sacred to the nymphs

				 				Called Naiads﻿—a wide-vaulted cave where once

				 				Thou earnest oft with chosen hecatombs,

				 				An offering to the nymphs﻿—and here thou seest

				 				The mountain Neritus with all his woods.”



			 				So spake the goddess, and dispersed the mist,

				 				And all the scene appeared. Ulysses saw

				 				Well pleased, rejoicing in his own dear land,

				 				And, stooping, kissed the bountiful earth, and raised

				 				His hands, and thus addressed the nymphs in prayer:﻿—



			 				“Nymphs, Naiads, born to Jove, I did not hope

				 				To be with you again. With cheerful prayers

				 				I now salute you. We shall bring you soon

				 				Our offerings, as of yore, if graciously

				 				Jove’s daughter, huntress-queen, shall grant me yet

				 				To live, and bless my well-beloved son.”



			 				And then the goddess, blue-eyed Pallas, said:

				 				“Be of good cheer, and let no anxious thought

				 				Disturb thy mind. Let us bestir ourselves

				 				To hide away the treasures thou hast brought

				 				Within this hallowed grot in some recess

				 				Where they may lie in safety; afterward

				 				Will we take counsel what should next be done.”



			 				The goddess said these words, and took her way

				 				Into the shadowy cavern, spying out

				 				Its hiding-places; while Ulysses brought

				 				The treasures thither in his arms﻿—the gold,

				 				The enduring brass, the raiment nobly wrought﻿—

				 				Which the Phaeacians gave him. These they laid

				 				Together in due order; Pallas then,

				 				The daughter of the Aegis-bearer Jove,

				 				Closed up the opening with a massive rock.

				 				Then, sitting by the sacred olive-tree,

				 				They plotted to destroy the haughty crew

				 				Of suitors, and the blue-eyed Pallas said:﻿—



			 				“O nobly born, and versed in many wiles,

				 				Son of Laertes! now the hour is come

				 				To think how thou shalt lay avenging hands

				 				Upon the shameless crew who, in thy house,

				 				For three years past have made themselves its lords,

				 				And wooed thy noble wife and brought her gifts,

				 				While, pining still for thy return, she gave

				 				Hopes to each suitor, and by messages

				 				Made promises to all, though cherishing

				 				A different purpose in her secret heart.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered her:

				 				“Ah me, I should have perished utterly,

				 				By such an evil fate as overtook

				 				Atrides Agamemnon, in the halls

				 				Of my own palace, but for thee, whose words,

				 				O goddess, have revealed what I should know.

				 				Now counsel me how I may be avenged.

				 				Be ever by my side, and strengthen me

				 				With courage, as thou didst when we o’erthrew

				 				The towery crest of Ilium. Would thou wert

				 				Still my ally, as then! I would engage,

				 				O blue-eyed Pallas, with three hundred foes,

				 				If thou, dread goddess, wouldst but counsel me.”



			 				And then the blue-eyed Pallas spake again:

				 				“I will be present with thee. When we once

				 				Begin the work, thou shalt not leave my sight;

				 				And many a haughty suitor with his blood

				 				And brains shall stain thy spacious palace floor.

				 				Now will I change thine aspect, so that none

				 				Shall know thee. I will wither thy fair skin,

				 				And it shall hang on crooked limbs; thy locks

				 				Of auburn I will cause to fall away,

				 				And round thee fling a cloak which all shall see

				 				With loathing. I will make thy lustrous eyes

				 				Dull to the sight, and thus shalt thou appear

				 				A squalid wretch to all the suitor train,

				 				And to thy wife, and to the son whom thou

				 				Didst leave within thy palace. Then at first

				 				Repair thou to the herdsman, him who keeps

				 				Thy swine; for he is loyal, and he loves

				 				Thy son and the discreet Penelope.

				 				There wilt thou find him as he tends his swine,

				 				That find their pasturage beside the rock

				 				Of Corax, and by Arethusa’s fount.

				 				On nourishing acorns they are fed, and drink

				 				The dark clear water, whence the flesh of swine

				 				Is fattened. There remain, and carefully

				 				Inquire of all that thou wouldst know, while I,

				 				Taking my way to Sparta, the abode

				 				Of lovely women, call Telemachus,

				 				Thy son, Ulysses, who hath visited

				 				King Menelaus in his broad domain,

				 				To learn if haply thou art living yet.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered her:

				 				“Why didst not thou, to whom all things are known,

				 				Tell him concerning me? Must he too roam

				 				And suffer on the barren deep, and leave

				 				To others his estates, to be their spoil?”



			 				And then the blue-eyed goddess spake again:

				 				“Let not that thought distress thee. It was I

				 				Who sent him thither, that he might deserve

				 				The praise of men. No evil meets him there;

				 				But in the halls of Atreus’ son he sits,

				 				Safe mid the abounding luxuries. ’Tis true

				 				That even now the suitors lie in wait,

				 				In their black ship, to slay him ere he reach

				 				His native land; but that will hardly be

				 				Before the earth shall cover many a one

				 				Of the proud suitors who consume thy wealth.”



			 				So Pallas spake, and touched him with her wand,

				 				And caused the blooming skin to shrivel up

				 				On his slow limbs, and the fair hair to fall,

				 				And with an old man’s wrinkles covered all

				 				His frame, and dimmed his lately glorious eyes.

				 				Another garb she gave﻿—a squalid vest;

				 				A ragged, dirty cloak, all stained with smoke;

				 				And over all the huge hide of a stag,

				 				From which the hair was worn. A staff, beside,

				 				She gave, and shabby scrip with many a rent,

				 				Tied with a twisted thong. This said and done,

				 				They parted; and the goddess flew to seek

				 				Telemachus in Sparta’s sacred town.





						Book 						XIV


					Meeting of Ulysses and Eumaeus


				 				Hospitable reception by Eumaeus of Ulysses in the disguise of a beggar﻿—His feigned accouut of himself﻿—His promise that Ulysses shall return﻿—Supper in the lodge of Eumaeus﻿—Stratagem of Ulysses to procure a cloak for the night.





				Then from the haven up the rugged path

				 				Ulysses went among the woody heights.

				 				He sought the spot where Pallas bade him meet

				 				The noble swineherd, who of all that served

				 				The great Ulysses chiefly had in charge

				 				To bring the day’s supplies. He found him there

				 				Seated beneath the portico, before

				 				His airy lodge, that might be seen from far,

				 				Well built and spacious, standing by itself.

				 				Eumaeus, while his lord was far away,

				 				Had built it, though not bidden by the queen

				 				Nor old Laertes, with the stones he drew

				 				From quarries thither. Round it he had set

				 				A hedge of thorns, encircling these with stakes

				 				Close set and many, cloven from the heart

				 				Of oak. Within that circuit he had made

				 				Twelve sties, beside each other, for the swine

				 				To lie in. Fifty wallowed in each sty,

				 				All females; there they littered. But the males

				 				Were fewer, and were kept without; and these

				 				The suitor train made fewer every day,

				 				Feeding upon them, for Eumaeus sent

				 				Always the best of all his fatling herd.

				 				These numbered twice nine score. Beside them slept

				 				Four mastiffs, which the master swineherd fed,

				 				Savage as wolves. Eumaeus to his feet

				 				Was fitting sandals, which he carved and shaped

				 				From a stained ox-hide, while the other hinds

				 				Were gone on different errands﻿—three to drive

				 				The herds of swine﻿—a fourth was sent to take

				 				A fatling to the city, that the crew

				 				Of arrogant suitors, having offered him

				 				In sacrifice, might feast upon his flesh.



			 				The loud-mouthed dogs that saw Ulysses come

				 				Ran toward him, fiercely baying. He sat down

				 				At once, through caution, letting fall his staff

				 				Upon the ground, and would have suffered there

				 				Unseemly harm, within his own domain,

				 				But then the swineherd, following with quick steps,

				 				Rushed through the vestibule, and dropped the hide.

				 				He chid the dogs and, pelting them with stones,

				 				Drave them asunder, and addressed the king:﻿—



			 				“O aged man, the mastiffs of the lodge

				 				Had almost torn thee, and thou wouldst have cast

				 				Bitter reproach upon me. Other griefs

				 				And miseries the gods have made my lot.

				 				Here sorrowfully sitting I lament

				 				A godlike master, and for others tend

				 				His fading swine; while, haply hungering

				 				For bread, he wanders among alien men

				 				In other kingdoms, if indeed he lives

				 				And looks upon the sun. But follow me,

				 				And come into the house, that there, refreshed

				 				With food and wine, old man, thou mayst declare

				 				Whence thou dost come and what thou hast endured.”



			 				So the good swineherd spake, and led the way

				 				Into the lodge, and bade his guest sit down,

				 				And laid thick rushes for his seat, and spread

				 				On these a wild goat’s shaggy hide to make

				 				A soft and ample couch. Rejoiced to meet

				 				So kind a welcome, thus Ulysses spake:﻿—



			 				“May Jupiter and all the deathless gods

				 				Bestow on thee, my host, in recompense

				 				Of this kind welcome, all thy heart’s desire!”



			 				And then, Eumaeus, thou didst answer thus:

				 				“My guest, it were not right to treat with scorn

				 				A stranger, though he were of humbler sort

				 				Than thou, for strangers and the poor are sent

				 				By Jove; our gifts are small, though gladly given,

				 				As it must ever be with those who serve

				 				Young masters, whom they fear. The gods themselves

				 				Prevent, no doubt, the safe return of him

				 				Who loved me much, and would ere this have given

				 				What a kind lord is wont to give his hind﻿—

				 				A house, a croft, the wife whom he has wooed,

				 				Rewarding faithful services which God

				 				Hath prospered, as he here hath prospered mine.

				 				Thus would my master, had he here grown old,

				 				Have recompensed my toils; but he is dead.

				 				O that the house of Helen, for whose sake

				 				So many fell, had perished utterly!

				 				For he went forth at Agamemnon’s call,

				 				Honoring the summons, and on Ilium’s coast,

				 				Famed for its coursers, fought the sons of Troy.”



			 				He spake, and girt his tunic round his loins,

				 				And hastened to the sties in which the herds

				 				Of swine were lying. Thence he took out two

				 				And slaughtered them, and singed them, sliced the flesh,

				 				And fixed it upon spits, and, when the whole

				 				Was roasted, brought and placed it reeking hot,

				 				Still on the spits and sprinkled with white meal,

				 				Before Ulysses. Then he mingled wine

				 				Of delicate flavors in a wooden bowl,

				 				And opposite Ulysses sat him down,

				 				And thus with kindly words bespake his guest:﻿—



			 				“Feast, stranger, on these porkers. We who serve

				 				May feed on them; it is the suitor train

				 				That banquet on the fatted swine﻿—the men

				 				Who neither fear heaven’s anger nor are moved

				 				By pity. The great gods are never pleased

				 				With violent deeds; they honor equity

				 				And justice. Even those who land as foes

				 				And spoilers upon foreign shores, and bear

				 				Away much plunder by the will of Jove,

				 				Returning homeward with their laden barques,

				 				Feel, brooding heavily upon their minds,

				 				The fear of vengeance. But these suitors know﻿—

				 				For haply they have heard some god declare﻿—

				 				That he, the king, is dead; they neither make

				 				Their suit with decency, nor will withdraw

				 				To their own homes, but at their ease devour

				 				His substance with large waste, and never spare.

				 				Of all the days and nights which Jupiter

				 				Gives to mankind is none when they require

				 				A single victim only, or but two,

				 				For sacrifice, and lavishly they drain

				 				His wine-jars. Once large revenues were his.

				 				No hero on the dark-soiled continent

				 				Nor in the isle of Ithaca possessed

				 				Such wealth as he, nor even twenty men

				 				Together. Hear me while I give the amount.

				 				Twelve herds of kine that on the mainland graze

				 				Are his, as many flocks of sheep, of swine

				 				As many droves; as many flocks of goats

				 				Are tended there by strangers, and by hinds,

				 				His servants. Here moreover, in the fields

				 				Beyond us, graze eleven numerous flocks

				 				Of goats, attended by his trusty men,

				 				Each one of whom brings daily home a goat,

				 				The finest of the fatlings. I meantime

				 				Am keeper of these swine, and from the drove

				 				I choose and to the palace send the best.”



			 				So spake the swineherd, while Ulysses ate

				 				The flesh with eager appetite, and drank

				 				The wine in silence, meditating woe

				 				To all the suitors. When the meal was o’er,

				 				And he was strengthened by the food, his host

				 				Filled up with wine the cup from which he drank.

				 				And gave it to Ulysses, who, well pleased,

				 				Received it, and with winged words replied:﻿—



			 				“What rich and mighty chief was he, my friend,

				 				Of whom thou speakest, and who purchased thee?

				 				Thou sayest that he died to swell the fame

				 				Of Agamemnon. Tell his name, for I

				 				Perchance know somewhat of him. Jupiter

				 				And the great gods know whether I have seen

				 				The man, and have some tidings for thy ear;

				 				For I have wandered over many lands.”



			 				And then again the noble swineherd spake:

				 				“O aged man, no wanderer who should bring

				 				News of Ulysses e’er would win his wife

				 				And son to heed the tale. For roving men,

				 				In need of hospitality, are prone

				 				To falsehood, and will never speak the truth.

				 				The vagabond who comes to Ithaca

				 				Goes straightway to my mistress with his lies.

				 				Kindly she welcomes him, and cherishes

				 				And questions him, while tears abundantly

				 				Fall from her lids﻿—such tears as women shed

				 				Whose lords have perished in a distant land.

				 				Thou too, old man, perchance, couldst readily

				 				Frame a like fable, if someone would give

				 				A change of raiment for thy news﻿—a cloak

				 				And tunic. But the dogs and fowls of air

				 				Have doubtless fed upon the frame from which

				 				The life has passed, and torn from off his bones

				 				The skin, or fishes of the deep have preyed

				 				Upon it, and his bones upon the shore

				 				Lie whelmed in sand. So is he lost to us,

				 				And sorrow is the lot of all his friends,

				 				Mine most of all; for nowhere shall I find

				 				So kind a master, though I were to come

				 				Into my father’s and my mother’s house,

				 				Where I was born and reared. Nor do I pine

				 				So much to look on them with my own eyes,

				 				And in my place of birth, as I lament

				 				Ulysses lost. Though he be far away,

				 				Yet must I ever speak, O stranger guest,

				 				His name with reverence, for exceedingly

				 				He loved me and most kindly cared for me;

				 				And though he is to be with us no more,

				 				I hold him as an elder brother still.”



			 				Ulysses, the great sufferer, thus replied:

				 				“Since then, my friend, thou dost not say nor think

				 				That he will come again, nor wilt believe

				 				My words, I now repeat, but with an oath,

				 				Ulysses will return. Let this reward

				 				Be given for my good news: the very hour

				 				When he once more is in his house, bestow

				 				On me a comely change of raiment﻿—cloak

				 				And tunic﻿—nor will I accept the gift,

				 				Though great my need, until he comes again.

				 				For as the gates of hell do I detest

				 				The man who, tempted by his poverty,

				 				Deceives with lying words. Now Jupiter

				 				Bear witness, and this hospitable board

				 				And hearth of good Ulysses where I sit,

				 				That all which I foretell will come to pass.

				 				This very year Ulysses will return.

				 				He, when this month goes out, and as the next

				 				Is entering, will be here in his domain,

				 				To be avenged on those, whoe’er they be,

				 				That dare insult his wife and noble son.”



			 				And then, Eumaeus, thou didst answer thus:

				 				“Old man, I shall not give thee that reward,

				 				For never will Ulysses come again

				 				To his own palace. Drink thy wine in peace,

				 				And let us give our thoughts to other things.

				 				Remind me not of this again; my heart

				 				Grows heavy in my bosom when I hear

				 				My honored master named. But leave the oath

				 				Unsworn, and may Ulysses come, as we

				 				Earnestly wish﻿—I and Penelope,

				 				And old Laertes, and the godlike youth

				 				Telemachus. And then, again, I bear

				 				Perpetual sorrow for Telemachus,

				 				My master’s son, to whom the gods had given

				 				A generous growth like that of some young plant,

				 				And who, I hoped, would prove no less in worth

				 				Than his own father, and of eminent gifts

				 				In form and mind. Some god, perchance some man,

				 				Hath caused that mind to lose its equal poise,

				 				And he is gone to Pylos the divine

				 				For tidings of his father. Meanwhile here

				 				The arrogant suitors plan to lie in wait

				 				For him as he returns, that utterly

				 				The stock of great Arcesius from our isle

				 				May perish, and its name be heard no more.

				 				Speak we no more of him, be it his fate

				 				To fall or flee; but O, may Saturn’s son

				 				Protect him with his arm! And now, old man,

				 				Relate, I pray, thy fortunes; tell me true,

				 				That I may know who thou mayst be, and whence

				 				Thou earnest, where thy city lies, and who

				 				Thy parents were, what galley landed thee

				 				Upon our coast, and how the manners

				 				Brought thee to Ithaca, and of what race

				 				They claim to be; for I may well suppose

				 				Thou hast not come to Ithaca on foot.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered him:

				 				“I will tell all and truly. Yet if here

				 				Were store of food, and wine for many days,

				 				And we might feast at ease within thy lodge

				 				While other labored, I should hardly end

				 				In a whole year the history of the woes

				 				Which I have borne, and of the many toils

				 				Which it hath pleased the gods to lay on me.



			 				“It is my boast that I am of the race

				 				Who dwell in spacious Crete, a rich man’s son,

				 				Within whose palace many other sons

				 				Were born and reared, the offspring of his wife;

				 				But me a purchased mother whom he made

				 				His concubine brought forth to him. And yet

				 				Castor Hylacides, from whom I sprang,

				 				Held me in equal favor with the rest;

				 				And he himself was honored like a god

				 				Among the Cretan people, for his wealth

				 				And for his prosperous life and gallant sons.

				 				But fate and death o’ertook and bore him down

				 				To Pluto’s realm, and his magnanimous sons

				 				Divided his large riches, casting lots.

				 				Small was the portion they assigned to me;

				 				They gave a dwelling, but my valor won

				 				A bride, the daughter of a wealthy house﻿—

				 				For I was not an idler, nor in war

				 				A coward; but all that is with the past.

				 				And thou, who seest the stubble now, mayst guess

				 				What was the harvest, ere calamities

				 				Had come so thick upon me. Once did Mars

				 				And Pallas lend me courage, and the power

				 				To break through ranks of armed men. Whene’er

				 				I formed an ambush of the bravest chiefs,

				 				And planned destruction to the enemy,

				 				My noble spirit never set the fear

				 				Of death before me; I was ever first

				 				To spring upon the foes, and with my spear

				 				To smite them as they turned their steps to flee.

				 				Such was I once in war; to till the fields

				 				I never liked, nor yet the household cares

				 				By which illustrious sons are reared. I loved

				 				Ships well appointed, combats, polished spears

				 				And arrows. Things that others hold in dread

				 				Were my delight; some god inclined to them

				 				My mind﻿—so true it is that different men

				 				Rejoice in different labors. Ere the sons

				 				Of Greece embarked for Troy, I served in war

				 				Nine times as leader against foreign foes,

				 				With troops and galleys under me, and then

				 				I prospered; from the mass of spoil I chose

				 				The things that pleased me, and obtained by lot

				 				Still other treasures. Thus my household grew

				 				In riches, and I was revered and great

				 				Among the Cretans. When all-seeing Jove

				 				Decreed the unhappy voyage to the coast

				 				Of Troy, they made the great Idomeneus

				 				And me commanders of the fleet. No power

				 				Had we﻿—the public clamor was so fierce﻿—

				 				To put the charge aside. Nine years we warred﻿—

				 				We sons of Greece﻿—and in the tenth laid waste

				 				The city of Priam, and embarked for home.

				 				Our fleets were scattered by the gods. For me

				 				Did all-disposing Jupiter ordain

				 				A wretched lot. But one short month I dwelt

				 				Happy among my children, with the wife

				 				Wedded to me in youth, and my large wealth.

				 				And then I planned a voyage to the coast

				 				Of Egypt, with a gallant fleet, and men

				 				Of godlike valor. I equipped nine ships,

				 				And quickly came the people to embark.

				 				Six days on shore my comrades banqueted,

				 				And many a victim for the sacrifice

				 				And for the feast I gave; the seventh we sailed

				 				From Crete’s broad isle before a favoring wind

				 				That blew from the clear north, and easily

				 				We floated on as down a stream. No ship

				 				Was harmed upon its way; in health and ease

				 				We sat, the wind and helmsmen guiding us,

				 				And came upon the fifth day to the land

				 				Of Egypt, watered by its noble streams.

				 				I bade my comrades keep beside our ships

				 				Upon the strand, and watch them well. I placed

				 				Sentries upon the Heights. Yet confident

				 				In their own strength, and rashly giving way

				 				To greed, my comrades ravaged the fair fields

				 				Of the Egyptians, slew them, and bore off 325 Their wives and little ones. The rumor reached

				 				The city soon; the people heard the alarm

				 				And came together. With the early morn

				 				All the great plain was thronged with horse and foot,

				 				And gleamed with brass; while Jove, the Thunderer, sent

				 				A deadly fear into our ranks, where none

				 				Dared face the foe. On every side was death.

				 				The Egyptians hewed down many with the sword,

				 				And some they led away alive to toil

				 				For them in slavery. To my mind there came

				 				A thought, inspired by Jove; yet I could wish

				 				That I had met my fate, and perished there

				 				In Egypt, such have been my sorrows since.

				 				I took the well-wrought helmet from my head,

				 				And from my shoulders dropped the shield, and flung

				 				The javelin from my hand, and went to meet

				 				The monarch in his chariot, clasped his knees

				 				And kissed them. He was moved to pity me,

				 				And spared me. In his car he seated me,

				 				And bore me weeping home. Though many rushed

				 				At me with ashen spears, to thrust me through﻿—

				 				For furious was their anger﻿—he forbade.

				 				He feared the wrath of Jove, the stranger’s friend

				 				And foe of wrong. Seven years I dwelt among

				 				The Egyptians, and I gathered in their land

				 				Large wealth, for all were liberal of their gifts.

				 				But with the eighth revolving year there came

				 				A shrewd Phoenician, deep in guile, whose craft

				 				Had wrought much wrong to many. With smooth words

				 				This man persuaded me to go with him

				 				Into Phoenicia, where his dwelling lay

				 				And his possessions. With him I abode

				 				For one whole year; and when its months and days

				 				Were ended, and another year began,

				 				He put me in a ship to cross the sea

				 				To Lybia. He had framed a treacherous plot,

				 				By making half the vessel’s cargo mine,

				 				To lure me thither, and to sell me there

				 				For a large price. I went on board constrained,

				 				But with misgivings. Under a clear sky,

				 				With favoring breezes from the north, we ran

				 				O’er the mid sea, beyond the isle of Crete.

				 				When we had left the isle, and saw no land

				 				But only sky and sea, Saturnius bade

				 				A black cloud gather o’er our roomy ship.

				 				The sea grew dark below. On high the God

				 				Thundered again and yet again, and sent

				 				A bolt into our ship, which, as it felt

				 				The lightning, reeled and shuddered, and was filled

				 				With sulphur-smoke. The seamen from the deck

				 				Fell headlong, and were tossed upon the waves

				 				Like seamews round our galley, which the God

				 				Forbade them to regain. But Jupiter

				 				Gave to my hands, bewildered as I was,

				 				Our dark-prowed galley’s mast, unbroken yet,

				 				That by its aid I might escape. I wound

				 				My arms around it, and the raging winds

				 				Swept me along. Nine days they bore me on,

				 				And on the tenth dark night a mighty surge

				 				Drifted me, as it rolled, upon the coast

				 				Of the Thesprotians. There the hero-king

				 				Of the Thesprotians freely sheltered me

				 				And fed me; for his well-beloved son

				 				Had found me overcome with cold and toil,

				 				And took me by the hand and raised me up,

				 				And led me to his father’s house, and gave

				 				Seemly attire, a tunic and a cloak.



			 				“There heard I of Ulysses. Pheidon told

				 				How he received him as a guest and friend,

				 				When on his homeward voyage. Then he showed

				 				The wealth Ulysses gathered, brass and gold,

				 				And steel divinely wrought. That store might serve

				 				To feed, until ten generations pass,

				 				Another household. But the chief himself,

				 				So Pheidon said, was at Dodona then;

				 				For he had gone to hear from the tall oak

				 				Of Jupiter the counsel of the God,

				 				Whether to land in opulent Ithaca,

				 				After long years of absence, openly

				 				Or in disguise. The monarch took an oath

				 				In his own palace, pouring to the gods

				 				Their wine, that even then the ship was launched,

				 				And the crew ready to attend him home.

				 				But me he first dismissed. There was a ship

				 				Of the Thesprotians just about to make

				 				A voyage to Dulichium, rich in fields

				 				Of wheat. He bade them take me faithfully

				 				To King Acastus; but another thought

				 				Found favor with the crew, a wicked scheme

				 				To plunge me deeper in calamity.

				 				And when our ship had sailed away from land,

				 				They hastened to prepare me for a life

				 				Of slavery. They took my garments off,

				 				Mantle and cloak, and clothed me in a vest

				 				And cloak, the very rags which thou dost see.

				 				The evening brought them to the pleasant fields

				 				Of Ithaca. They bound me in the ship

				 				With a strong cord, and disembarked, and took

				 				A hasty meal upon the ocean-side;

				 				Easily did the gods unbind my limbs.

				 				I wrapped a tattered cloth about my head,

				 				And, slipping from the polished rudder, brought

				 				My bosom to the sea, and spread my hands,

				 				And swam away. I soon had left the crew

				 				At distance; then I turned and climbed the shore,

				 				Where it was dark with forest, and lay close

				 				Within its shelter, while they wandered round

				 				And grumbled, but they ventured not to pass

				 				Into the island farther on their search.

				 				They turned, and went on board their roomy barque.

				 				Thus mightily the gods delivered me,

				 				And they have brought me to a wise man’s lodge,

				 				And now I see it is my lot to live.”



			 				Then thou, Eumaeus, thus didst make reply:

				 				“Unhappy stranger, thou hast deeply moved

				 				My heart in telling all that thou hast borne,

				 				And all thy wanderings. Yet are some things wrong.

				 				Thou hast not spoken of Ulysses well.

				 				Why should a man like thee invent such tales,

				 				So purposeless? Of one thing I am sure

				 				Concerning his return﻿—the gods all hate

				 				My master, since they neither caused his death

				 				In the great war of Troy, nor, when the war

				 				Was over, suffered him to die at home,

				 				And in the arms of those who loved him most;

				 				For then would all the Greeks have reared to him

				 				A monument, and mighty would have been

				 				The heritage of glory for his son;

				 				But now ingloriously the harpy brood

				 				Have torn him. I, apart among my swine,

				 				Go never to the town, unless, perchance,

				 				The sage Penelope requires me there,

				 				When someone comes with tidings from abroad.

				 				Then those who sorrow for their absent lord,

				 				And those who waste his substance, both inquire

				 				News of the king. For me, it suits me not

				 				Ever to ask for tidings, since the day

				 				When an Aetolian with a flattering tale

				 				Deceived me. He had slain a man, and came

				 				Wandering in many lands to my abode,

				 				And kindly I received him. He had seen,

				 				He said, my master with Idomeneus,

				 				Among the Cretans, putting in repair

				 				His galleys, shattered by a furious storm,

				 				And in the summer time he would be here,

				 				Or in the autumn, bringing ample wealth,

				 				And his brave comrades with him. Seek not then,

				 				O aged sufferer, whom some deity

				 				Has guided hither, to amuse my grief

				 				With fictions that may bring back pleasant thoughts,

				 				Since not for them I minister to thee

				 				And love thee, but through reverence for Jove﻿—

				 				The stranger’s friend﻿—and pity for thyself.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, spake again:

				 				“Within thy bosom thou dost bear a heart

				 				Of slow belief, since not the oath I take

				 				Persuades or even moves thee. Make we now

				 				A covenant, and let the gods who dwell

				 				Upon Olympus be our witnesses,

				 				That when thy master comes to this abode

				 				Thou wilt bestow a tunic and a cloak,

				 				And wilt despatch me clothed in seemly garb

				 				Hence to Dulichium, whither I would go.

				 				But if he come not as I have foretold,

				 				Then charge thy servants that they cast me down

				 				From a tall rock, that never beggar more

				 				May think to cozen thee with lying tales.”



			 				The noble swineherd answered him and said:

				 				“Great would my honor be, and I should gain

				 				Great praise for worth among the sons of men,

				 				If, having welcomed thee into my lodge

				 				And spread the board for thee, I took thy life;

				 				Then boldly might I pray to Saturn’s son.

				 				But see, the supper hour is come, and soon

				 				Will my companions be within, and they

				 				Will make a liberal banquet ready here.”



			 				Thus did the twain confer. Now came the swine,

				 				And those who tended them. They penned the herd

				 				In their enclosure, and a din of cries

				 				Rose as they entered. Then the swineherd called

				 				To his companions: “Bring the best of all,

				 				And we will make an offering for the sake

				 				Of one who comes from far and is my guest.

				 				And we will also feast, for we have toiled

				 				Long time in tendance of this white-toothed herd,

				 				And others waste, unpunished, what we rear.”



			 				So spake he, and began to cleave the wood

				 				With the sharp steel; the others chose and brought

				 				A fatted brawn, and placed him on the hearth.

				 				Nor was the swineherd careless of the rites

				 				Due to the gods﻿—such was his piety.

				 				From off the white-toothed victim first he sheared

				 				The bristles of the forehead, casting them

				 				Into the flames, and prayed to all the gods

				 				For wise Ulysses and his safe return.

				 				Next, with a fragment of the oaken trunk

				 				Which he had just then cleft, he smote the boar,

				 				And the life left it. Then they cut its throat,

				 				And, having singed it, quickly hewed the parts

				 				Asunder, while the swineherd took and laid,

				 				On the rich fat, raw portions from the limbs

				 				For sacrifice, and other parts he cast,

				 				Sprinkled with flour of meal, into the flames;

				 				The rest they duly sliced and fixed on spits,

				 				And roasted carefully, and drew it back,

				 				And heaped it on the board. And now arose

				 				The swineherd to divide the whole, for well

				 				He knew the duty of a host. He made

				 				Seven parts; and one he offered to the Nymphs,

				 				To Hermes, son of Maia, one, and both

				 				With prayer; the rest he set before the guests,

				 				But, honoring Ulysses, gave to him

				 				The white-toothed victim’s ample chine. The king,

				 				The wise Ulysses, was well pleased, and said:﻿—



			 				“Eumaeus, be thou ever dear to Jove

				 				As to myself, since with thy benefits

				 				Thou freely honorest such a one as I.”



			 				And thou, Eumaeus, madest answer thus:

				 				“Eat, venerable stranger, and enjoy

				 				What is before us. At his pleasure God

				 				Gives or withholds; his power is over all.”



			 				He spake, and burned to the eternal gods

				 				The firstlings, and poured out the dark red wine,

				 				And to Ulysses, spoiler of walled towns,

				 				Who sat beside the table, gave the cup.

				 				Meantime to each Mesaulius brought the bread﻿—

				 				A servant whom Eumaeus, while his lord

				 				Was far away, had taken for himself,

				 				Without the order of Penelope

				 				Or old Laertes; from the Taphian tribe

				 				With his own goods he bought him. Now the guests

				 				Put forth their hands and shared the ready feast;

				 				And when their thirst and hunger were appeased

				 				Mesaulius took the bread away, and all,

				 				Satiate with food and wine, lay down to rest.



			 				Then came the darkness on, without a moon;

				 				And Jupiter the whole night long sent down

				 				The rain, and strong the showery west-wind blew.

				 				And now to try the swineherd, if with all

				 				His kindly ministrations to his guest

				 				He yet would spare to him his cloak, or bid

				 				Another do the like, Ulysses spake:﻿—



			 				“Eumaeus, hearken thou, and all the rest,

				 				Thy comrades, while I utter boastful words.

				 				Wine makes me foolish, it can even cause

				 				The wise to sing and laugh a silly laugh

				 				And dance, and often to the lips it brings

				 				Words that were better left unsaid. But since

				 				I have begun to prattle, I will not

				 				Keep back my thought. I would I were as young

				 				And in the same full strength as when I formed

				 				Part of an ambush near the walls of Troy.

				 				The leaders were Ulysses, and the son

				 				Of Atreus, Menelaus, with myself

				 				The third, for they desired it. When we reached

				 				The city and the lofty walls we lay

				 				Couched in a marshy spot among the reeds

				 				And thick-grown shrubs, with all our armor on.

				 				’Twas an inclement night, and the north-wind

				 				Blew bitter chill, the cold snow fell and lay

				 				White like hoar frost; ice gathered on our shields.

				 				The rest had cloaks and tunics, and they slept

				 				At ease, their shoulders covered with their shields.

				 				I only, when I joined the squadron, left

				 				My cloak unwisely, for I had not thought

				 				Of such fierce cold. I went but with my shield

				 				And my embroidered girdle. When the night

				 				Was in its later watches, and the stars

				 				Were turning toward their set, I thus bespake

				 				Ulysses near me, thrusting in his side

				 				My elbow, and he listened readily:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Son of Laertes, nobly born and wise!

				 				Ulysses, I shall not be long among

				 				The living; for I perish with the cold.

				 				I have no cloak; some god misled my thought,

				 				So that I brought one garment and no more,

				 				And now I see there is no help for me.’



			 				“I spake, and instantly his mind conceived

				 				This stratagem﻿—such was his readiness

				 				In council and in battle﻿—and he said

				 				To me in a low voice: ‘Be silent now,

				 				And let no others of the Achaians hear!’

				 				And leaning on his elbow thus he spake:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Hear me, my friends: a dream has come from heaven

				 				Into my sleep. Far from our ships we lie;

				 				And now let someone haste to bear from us

				 				This word to Agamemnon, Atreus’ son,

				 				The shepherd of the people, that he send

				 				More warriors to this ambush from the fleet.’



			 				“He spake, and Thoas instantly arose﻿—

				 				Andraemon’s son﻿—and threw his purple cloak

				 				Aside, and hastened toward the fleet. I took

				 				Gladly the garment he had left, and lay

				 				Till Morning in her golden chariot came.

				 				And now I would that I were young again,

				 				And in the vigor of my prime, for then

				 				Someone among the swineherds in the stalls

				 				Would find, I think, a cloak for me, through love

				 				And reverence of such a man; but now

				 				They hold me in slight favor, dressed in rags.”



			 				And thus, Eumaeus, thou didst make reply:

				 				“O aged man! we see no cause of blame

				 				In thy recital, and of all thy words

				 				Not one is unbecoming or inapt.

				 				Thou shalt not lack for garments, nor aught else

				 				That any suppliant in his poverty

				 				Might hope for at our hands tonight. With morn

				 				Gird thou thy tatters on again; for here

				 				We have not many cloaks, nor many a change

				 				Of raiment﻿—only one for each of us.

				 				But when the son of our Ulysses comes

				 				Again, he will provide thee with a cloak

				 				And tunic, and will send thee where thou wilt.”



			 				He spake and rose, and made his guest a bed

				 				Close to the hearth, and threw on it the skins

				 				Of sheep and goats, and there Ulysses lay,

				 				O’er whom the swineherd spread a thick large cloak,

				 				Which he had often worn for a defence

				 				When a wild winter storm was in the air.



			 				Thus slept Ulysses with the young men near.

				 				A couch within, and distant from his charge,

				 				Pleased not the swineherd, who first armed himself,

				 				And then went forth. Ulysses gladly saw

				 				That while he was in distant lands his goods

				 				Were watched so faithfully. Eumaeus hung

				 				About his sturdy shoulders a sharp sword,

				 				And wrapped a thick cloak round him, tempest-proof,

				 				And took the hide of a huge pampered goat,

				 				And a well-pointed javelin for defence

				 				Both against dogs and men. So went he forth

				 				To take his rest where lay the white-toothed swine,

				 				Herded and slumbering underneath a rock,

				 				Whose hollow fenced themfrom the keen north-wind.





						Book 						XV


					Return of Telemachus


				 				Appearance of Pallas in a dream to Telemachus, warning him to return to Ithaca﻿—His departure from Lacedaemon, and arrival at Pylos﻿—Theoclymenus, an augur, taken on board by him at Pylos﻿—The story of Eumaeus related by him to Ulysses﻿—Arrival of Telemachus at the coast of Ithaca﻿—The ship sent forward to the city, while Telemachus, having committed Theoclymenus to the care of his friend Piraeus, goes to the lodge of Eumaeus.





				Then Pallas, hastening to the mighty realm

				 				Of Lacedaemon, sought the illustrious son

				 				Of great Ulysses, to remind the youth

				 				Of home, and bid him think of his return.

				 				She found Telemachus and Nestor’s son

				 				Upon their couches in the portico

				 				Of Menelaus, the renowned. Deep sleep

				 				Held Nestor’s son; but to Telemachus

				 				The welcome slumber came not, for his thoughts

				 				Uneasily through all the quiet night

				 				Dwelt on his father. Now beside his bed

				 				The blue-eyed Pallas took her stand and spake:﻿—



			 				“Telemachus, it is no longer well

				 				That thou shouldst wander from thy home, and leave

				 				All thy possessions, and those arrogant men

				 				That crowd thy halls. Beware, lest they devour

				 				Thy substance utterly, dividing all

				 				Among them, and this journey be for naught.

				 				Make suit to Menelaus, great in war,

				 				Quickly to send thee home, that thou mayst join

				 				Thy blameless mother in thy halls; for now

				 				Her father and her brothers counsel her

				 				To wed Eurymachus, whose gifts exceed

				 				Those of the other suitors, and besides

				 				He offers a yet richer bridal dower.

				 				It were not hard without thy leave to take

				 				Wealth from a palace. What a wife will do

				 				Thou knowest. ’Tis her pleasure to increase

				 				The riches of the man whom she has wed.

				 				Care of her former children has she none,

				 				Nor memory of the husband whom she took

				 				While yet a maid, and who is in his grave;

				 				Of these she never speaks. Return thou, then,

				 				And give thy goods in charge to one among

				 				The handmaids of thy household who shall seem

				 				The fittest for the trust, until the gods

				 				Bring thee a noble wife. Another word

				 				Have I for thee, and bear thou it in mind:

				 				The chief among the suitors in the strait

				 				Between the rugged Samos and the isle

				 				Of Ithaca are lurking, in the hope

				 				To slay thee on thy voyage home; but this

				 				I think they cannot do before the earth

				 				Hold many of the suitor-crew who make

				 				Thy wealth a spoil. Steer thou thy gallant barque

				 				Far from the isles; sail only in the night.

				 				Some god, whoever it may be that keeps

				 				Watch over thee, will send a prosperous gale.

				 				When to the nearest shore of Ithaca

				 				Thou comest in thy ship, let it go on,

				 				With all thy comrades, to the town, while thou

				 				Repairest to the keeper of thy swine,

				 				Whose heart is faithful to thee. There remain

				 				With him that night, and send him to the town

				 				With tidings to the sage Penelope

				 				That thou art come from Pylos and art safe.”



			 				So having said, the goddess took her way

				 				Up to the Olympian height. Telemachus

				 				Touched with his heel and wakened Nestor’s son

				 				From a soft slumber and bespake him thus:﻿—



			 				“Rise, Nestor’s son, Peisistratus, and bring

				 				The firm-paced steeds and yoke them to the car,

				 				And we will now set forth upon our way.”



			 				And Nestor’s son, Peisistratus, replied:

				 				“Telemachus, whatever be our haste,

				 				It were not well in darkness to begin

				 				Our journey, and the morn will soon be here.

				 				Remain till Menelaus, Atreus’ son,

				 				The hero mighty with the spear, shall come,

				 				And bring his gifts, and place them in our car,

				 				And send us on our way with kindly words.

				 				Well does a guest remember all his days

				 				The generous host who shows himself his friend.”



			 				He spake, and quickly on her car of gold

				 				Appeared the Mom. Then Menelaus came,

				 				The great in battle, from his couch beside

				 				The fair-haired Helen. When Telemachus

				 				Knew of the king’s approach, the hero threw

				 				In haste his tunic o’er his noble form,

				 				And over his broad shoulders flung a cloak

				 				Of ample folds. Then, going forth, the son

				 				Of great Ulysses met the king and said:﻿—



			 				“Atrides Menelaus, loved of Jove

				 				And sovereign of the people, send me hence,

				 				I pray, to the dear country of my birth,

				 				For earnestly I long to be at home.”



			 				And Menelaus, great in war, replied:

				 				“Telemachus, I will not keep thee long,

				 				Since thou so much desirest to return.

				 				I am displeased with him who as a host

				 				Is lavish of his love, for he will hate

				 				Beyond due measure; best it is to take

				 				The middle way. It is alike a wrong

				 				To thrust the unwilling stranger out of doors,

				 				And to detain him when he longs to go.

				 				While he is with us we should cherish him,

				 				And, when he wishes, help him to depart.

				 				Remain until I bring thee worthy gifts

				 				And place them in thy chariot, that thine eyes

				 				May look on them; and I will give command

				 				That in the palace here the women spread

				 				A liberal feast from stores that lie within.

				 				But if, in turning from thy course, thou choose

				 				To pass through Hellas and the midland tract

				 				Of Argos, I will yoke my steeds and go

				 				With thee, and show the cities thronged with men;

				 				Nor will they send us empty-handed thence,

				 				But bring us gifts which we may bear away﻿—

				 				Tripod, perchance, or cauldron wrought of brass,

				 				Perchance a pair of mules or golden cup.”



			 				Then spake discreet Telemachus in turn:

				 				“Atrides Menelaus, loved of Jove

				 				And sovereign of the people, rather far

				 				Would I return to my own home; for there

				 				Is no man left in charge of what is mine,

				 				And I must go, lest, while I vainly seek

				 				My father, I may perish, or may lose

				 				Some valued treasure from my palace rooms.”



			 				The valiant Menelaus heard, and bade

				 				His wife and maidens spread without delay

				 				A ready banquet from the stores within.

				 				Then Eteöneus from his morning sleep,

				 				Son of Boëtheus, came, for very near

				 				His dwelling was. The sovereign bade him light

				 				A fire and roast the flesh, and he obeyed.

				 				And then into the fragrant treasure-room

				 				Descended Menelaus, not alone;

				 				Helen and Megapenthes went with him.

				 				And when they came to where the treasures lay,

				 				Atrides took a double goblet up,

				 				And bade his son, young Megapenthes, bear

				 				A silver beaker thence, while Helen stood

				 				Beside the coffers where the embroidered robes

				 				Wrought by her hands were laid. The glorious dame

				 				Took one and brought it forth, most beautiful

				 				In needlework, and amplest of them all.

				 				The garment glittered like a star, and lay

				 				Below the other robes. Then, passing through

				 				The palace halls, they found Telemachus,

				 				And thus the fair-haired Menelaus spake:﻿—



			 				“Telemachus, may Jove the Thunderer,

				 				Husband of Juno, grant thee to return

				 				According to thy wish! I give thee here

				 				Of all the treasures which my house contains

				 				The fairest and most precious. I present

				 				A goblet all of silver, save the lips,

				 				And they are bound with gold; it is the work

				 				Of Vulcan. Phaedimus the hero, king

				 				Of the Sidonians, gave it me when once

				 				His palace sheltered me. He gave it me

				 				At parting, and I now would have it thine.”



			 				Atrides spake, and gave into his hands

				 				The double goblet. Megapenthes next

				 				Before him set the shining beaker wrought

				 				Of silver. Rosy Helen, holding up

				 				The robe, drew near, and spake to him and said:﻿—



			 				“I also bring to thee, dear son, a gift,

				 				The work of Helen’s hands, which thou shalt keep,

				 				In memory of her, until the day

				 				Of thy desired espousals, when thy bride

				 				Shall wear it. Let it in the meantime lie

				 				Within thy halls, in thy dear mother’s care;

				 				And mayst thou soon and happily arrive

				 				At thy fair palace and thy native coast.”



			 				So spake she, placing in his hands the robe.

				 				He took it, and was glad. Peisistratus

				 				Was moved with wonder as he saw, and laid

				 				The presents in the car. The fair-haired king

				 				Then led them to the hall, and seated them

				 				On thrones and couches, where a maiden brought

				 				Water in a fair golden ewer, and o’er

				 				A silver basin poured it for their hands,

				 				And near them set a table smoothly wrought.

				 				The matron of the palace brought them bread

				 				And many a delicate dish to please the taste

				 				From stores within the house. Then to the board

				 				Boëtheus’ son drew near and carved the meats,

				 				And gave to each a portion, while the son

				 				Of glorious Menelaus poured the wine.

				 				The guests put forth their hands and shared the food

				 				That lay prepared before them. When the calls

				 				Of thirst and hunger ceased, Telemachus

				 				And Nestor’s famous son brought forth and yoked

				 				The steeds, and climbed into the sumptuous car,

				 				And drove from out the echoing portico.

				 				Atrides Menelaus, amber-haired,

				 				Went forth with them, and, holding in his hand

				 				A golden cup of generous wine, poured out

				 				An offering for their voyage to the gods.

				 				Before the steeds he took his stand, and first

				 				Drank from the cup, and then bespake the guests:﻿—



			 				“Now fare ye well, young men, and when ye come

				 				To Nestor, shepherd of the people, give

				 				Greetings from me; for he was kind to me

				 				As if he were a father, when the sons

				 				Of Greece were warring in the realm of Troy.”



			 				Then spake in turn discreet Telemachus:

				 				“Assuredly I shall relate to him,

				 				As soon as I am with him, all that thou,

				 				foster-child of Jove, hast bid me say;

				 				And would to heaven I might as surely tell

				 				Ulysses in his palace, when again

				 				I come to Ithaca, how welcome thou

				 				Hast made me here, and how I came away

				 				With treasures rich and many from thy court.”



			 				As thus he spake, an eagle to the right

				 				Appeared, that, flying, bore a large white goose,

				 				Clutched from the tame flock in the palace court;

				 				And men and women ran the way he flew,

				 				And shouted after him. Before the steeds

				 				Of the young men, and still on the right hand,

				 				The bird went sweeping on. They saw well pleased,

				 				And every heart was gladdened. To the rest

				 				Peisistratus, the son of Nestor, said:﻿—



			 				“Now tell me, Menelaus, loved of Jove,

				 				Prince of the people! does the god who sends

				 				This portent mean the sign for us or thee?”



			 				He spake; and Menelaus, dear to Mars,

				 				Paused, thinking how to answer him aright,

				 				When thus the long-robed Helen interposed:﻿—



			 				“Listen to me, and I will prophesy

				 				As the gods prompt me, and as I believe

				 				The event will be. Just as this eagle came

				 				From the wild hills, his birthplace and his haunt,

				 				And seized and bore away the waterfowl

				 				Reared near our halls, so will Ulysses come,

				 				After much hardship and long wanderings,

				 				To his own home, to be avenged: perchance

				 				Already is at home, and meditates

				 				An evil end to all the suitor crew.”



			 				Then spake discreet Telemachus in turn:

				 				“May Juno’s husband, Jove the Thunderer,

				 				So order the event, and I will there

				 				Make vows to thee as to a deity.”



			 				He spake, and touched the coursers with the lash;

				 				And through the city rapidly they went

				 				And toward the plain, and all day long they shook

				 				The yoke upon their necks. The sun went down:

				 				The roads all lay in darkness as they came

				 				To Pherae, and the house of Diodes,

				 				Whose father was Orsilochus, and he

				 				The offspring of Alpheius. There that night

				 				They slept; their host was liberal of his cheer.

				 				But when appeared the daughter of the Dawn,

				 				The rosy-fingered Morn, they yoked the steeds

				 				And climbed the sumptuous car, and drove afield

				 				From underneath the echoing portico.

				 				The son of Nestor plied the lash; the steeds

				 				Flew not unwillingly, and quickly reached

				 				The lofty citadel of Pylos. There

				 				Telemachus bespake his comrade thus:﻿—



			 				“Wilt thou consent to do what I shall ask,

				 				O son of Nestor? ’Tis our boast that we

				 				Are friends because our fathers were; besides,

				 				We are of equal age, and journeying thus

				 				Has made our friendship firmer. Take me not,

				 				O foster-child of Jove, beyond the spot

				 				Where lies my galley, lest against my will

				 				The aged Nestor should detain me here

				 				Through kindness, when I needs must hasten home.”



			 				He spake, and then the son of Nestor mused

				 				How what his friend desired might best be done.

				 				And this seemed wisest after careful thought:

				 				He turned the chariot to the ship and shore,

				 				And taking out the garments and the gold﻿—

				 				Beautiful gifts which Menelaus gave﻿—

				 				He put them in the galley’s stern, and thus

				 				Bespake Telemachus with winged words:﻿—



			 				“Embark in haste, and summon all thy crew

				 				On board before I reach my home and tell

				 				The aged king. I know how vehement

				 				His temper is; he will not let thee go,

				 				But hastening hither to enforce thy stay,

				 				At Pylos, will not, I am sure, go back

				 				Without thee; his displeasure will be great.”



			 				He spake, and toward the Pylian city turned

				 				His steeds with flowing manes, and quickly reached

				 				His home. Meantime Telemachus held forth

				 				To his companions, thus exhorting them:﻿—



			 				“My friends, make ready all things in our ship

				 				And mount the deck, for we must now set sail.”



			 				He spake, they hearkened and obeyed, and leaped

				 				On board and manned the benches. While he thus

				 				Was hastening his departure, offering prayer

				 				And pouring wine to Pallas at the stern,

				 				A stranger came, a seer, a fugitive

				 				From Argos, where his hand had slain a man.

				 				Melampus was his ancestor, who dwelt

				 				Some time in Pylos, mother of fair flocks﻿—

				 				Rich, and inhabiting a sumptuous house

				 				Among the Pylians. Afterward he joined

				 				Another people, fleeing from his home

				 				And from the mighty Neleus, haughtiest

				 				Of living men, who, seizing his large wealth,

				 				Held it a year by force. Melampus lay

				 				Meantime within the house of Phylacus

				 				Fast bound, and suffering greatly, both because

				 				Of Neleus’ daughter, and of his own mind

				 				Distempered by the unapproachable

				 				Erinnys. Yet did he escape from death,

				 				And drove the lowing herds to Phylace

				 				And Pylos, and avenged his cruel wrong

				 				On Neleus, carrying off his child to be

				 				A consort for his brother. Then he came

				 				Into the realm of Argos, famed for steeds;

				 				For there it was decreed that he should dwell,

				 				And rule o’er many of the Argive race.

				 				And there he took a wife and built a house﻿—

				 				A lofty pile; and there to him were born Antiphates and Mantius, valiant men.

				 				Antiphates was father of a son,

				 				The brave O’icleus, and to him was born

				 				Amphioraüs, one of those whose voice

				 				Rouses the nations. Aegis-bearing Jove

				 				And Phoebus loved him with exceeding love;

				 				Yet reached he not the threshold of old age,

				 				But, through the treachery of his bribed wife,

				 				Perished too soon at Thebes. To him were born

				 				Two sons, Alcmaeon and Amphilochus.

				 				Clytus and Polyphides were the sons

				 				Of Mantius; but Aurora, she who fills

				 				A golden chariot, bore away to heaven

				 				Clytus for his great beauty, there to dwell

				 				Among the immortals, while Apollo gave

				 				To Polyphides of the noble mind

				 				To be a prophet, first of living men,

				 				Since now Amphiaraüs was no more.

				 				His father had displeased him, and he went

				 				To Hyperesia, where he dwelt, and there

				 				Revealed to all what yet should come to pass.



			 				It was his son who now approached; his name

				 				Was Theoclymenus; he saw the prince

				 				Telemachus, who stood beside the swift

				 				Black ship, and, pouring a libation, prayed;

				 				And thus he said to him in winged words:﻿—



			 				“My friend, whom here beside this barque I find

				 				Making a pious offering, I entreat

				 				Both by that offering and the deity,

				 				And by thy life, and by the lives of these

				 				Who follow thee, declare to me the truth,

				 				And keep back naught of all that I inquire﻿—

				 				Who art thou, from what race of men, and where

				 				Thy city lies, and who thy parents are.”



			 				Then spake in turn discreet Telemachus:

				 				“Stranger, to every point I answer thee.

				 				I am by race a son of Ithaca,

				 				My father was Ulysses when alive,

				 				But he has died a miserable death;

				 				Long years has he been absent, and I came

				 				With my companions here, and this black ship,

				 				To gather tidings of my father’s fate.”



			 				Then said the godlike Theoclymenus:

				 				“I too, like thee, am far away from home;

				 				For I have slain a man of my own tribe,

				 				And he had many brothers, many friends,

				 				In Argos famed for steeds. Great is the power

				 				Of those Achaians, and I flee from them

				 				And the black doom of death, to be henceforth

				 				A wanderer among men. O, shelter me

				 				On board thy galley! I, a fugitive,

				 				Implore thy mercy, lest they overtake

				 				And slay me; they are surely on my track.”



			 				And thus discreet Telemachus replied:

				 				“If thou desire to come on board my ship,

				 				I shall not hinder thee. Come with us then,

				 				And take a friendly share in what we have.”



			 				So saying he received his brazen spear,

				 				And laid it on the good ship’s deck, and went

				 				Himself on board, and, taking at the stern

				 				His place, he seated Theoclymenus

				 				Beside him. Then the mariners cast loose

				 				The hawsers, and Telemachus gave forth

				 				The order to prepare for sea. They heard

				 				And eagerly obeyed; they raised the mast,

				 				A pine-tree stem﻿—and, bringing it to stand

				 				In its deep socket, bound it there with cords,

				 				And hoisted by their strongly twisted thongs

				 				The ship’s white sails. The blue-eyed Pallas sent

				 				A favorable and fresh-blowing wind,

				 				That swept the sky to drive more speedily

				 				The galley through the salt-sea waves. They came

				 				To Cruni, and to Chalcis pleasantly

				 				Watered by rivers. Now the sun went down;

				 				Night closed around their way, but onward still

				 				A favorable wind from Jupiter

				 				Toward Pherae bore them, and the hallowed coast

				 				Of Elis, where the Epeian race bear sway,

				 				And then among the isles whose rocky peaks

				 				Rise from the waters. Here Telemachus

				 				Mused thoughtfully on what his fate might be﻿—

				 				To perish by the ambush or escape.



			 				Meantime Ulysses and the swineherd sat

				 				At meat within the lodge; the other men

				 				Were at the board, and when the calls of thirst

				 				And hunger ceased, Ulysses spake to try

				 				The swineherd, whether he were bent to show

				 				Yet further kindness, and entreat his stay,

				 				Or whether he would send him to the town.



			 				“Eumaeus, hearken thou, and all the rest.

				 				Tomorrow ’tis my wish to go to town,

				 				That I may beg, and be no charge to thee

				 				And thy companions. Give me thy advice,

				 				And send a trusty guide to show the way.

				 				There will I roam the streets, for so I must,

				 				And haply someone there will give a cup

				 				Of wine and cake of meal. And when I find

				 				The house of great Ulysses, I will tell

				 				The sage Penelope the news I bring.

				 				Nay, I would even go among the crew

				 				Of arrogant suitors, who perhaps might give

				 				A meal, for there is plenty at their feasts,

				 				And I would do whatever they require.

				 				For let me tell thee, and do thou give heed,

				 				There lives no man who can contend with me

				 				In menial tasks﻿—to keep alive a fire

				 				With fuel, cleave dry wood, and carve and roast

				 				The meat and pour the wine﻿—whate’er is done

				 				By poor men waiting on the better sort.”



			 				And thou, Eumasus, keeper of the swine,

				 				Didst answer in displeasure: “Woe is me!

				 				How could thy bosom harbor such a thought?

				 				O stranger! thou must surely be resolved

				 				To perish if thy purpose be to go

				 				Among the suitor crew, whose insolence

				 				And riot reach the iron vault of heaven.

				 				Not such attendants minister to them

				 				As thou art, but fair youths arrayed in cloaks

				 				And tunics, with sleek heads and smooth of face.

				 				These wait at polished tables heavily

				 				Loaded with bread and flesh and wine. Stay thou

				 				Content among us, sure that no one here

				 				Is wearied by thy presence, neither I

				 				Nor any of my fellows. When he comes,

				 				The dear son of Ulysses will provide

				 				For thee the garments thou dost need﻿—a cloak

				 				And tunic﻿—and will send thee where thou wilt.”



			 				Ulysses, the great sufferer, answered thus:

				 				“I pray that thou mayst be as dear to Jove,

				 				The great All-Father, as thou art to me,

				 				Since through thy kindness I enjoy a pause

				 				Amid my weary wanderings. There is naught

				 				Worse than a wandering life. Unseemly cares

				 				A hungry stomach brings to homeless men;

				 				Hardship and grief are theirs. But since thou wilt

				 				That I remain and wait for thy young lord,

				 				Speak to me of the mother of thy chief

				 				Ulysses, and his father, whom he left

				 				Just on the threshold of old age, if yet

				 				They live, and still may look upon the sun;

				 				Or have they died, and passed to Pluto’s realm?”



			 				And then in turn the master swineherd spake:

				 				“Rightly and truly will I answer thee,

				 				stranger! still Laertes lives, but prays

				 				Continually to Jove that he may die

				 				In his own house; for sorely he laments

				 				His son long absent, and his excellent wife,

				 				Bride of his youth, whose death has brought on him

				 				Sharp sorrow, and old age before its time.

				 				By a sad death she died﻿—through wasting grief

				 				For her lost, glorious son. May no one here,

				 				No friend of mine, nor one who has bestowed

				 				A kindness on me, die by such a death!

				 				While yet she lived, great as her sorrow was,

				 				I loved to speak with her and hear her words;

				 				For she had reared me with her youngest-born﻿—

				 				Her daughter, long-robed Ctimena. With her

				 				Was I brought up, and scarcely less than her

				 				Was held in honor. When at length we came

				 				Into the pleasant years of youth, they sent

				 				The princess hence to Samos, and received at

				 				Large presents; but to me her mother gave

				 				Garments of price, a tunic and a cloak,

				 				And sandals for my feet, and sent me forth

				 				Into the fields, and loved me more and more.

				 				All this is over now, yet must I say

				 				My calling has been prospered by the gods.

				 				From this I have the means to eat and drink,

				 				And wherewithal to feast a worthy guest;

				 				But from the queen I never have a word

				 				Or deed of kindness, since that evil came

				 				Upon her house﻿—that crew of lawless men.

				 				Greatly the servants would rejoice to speak

				 				Before their mistress, and inquire her will,

				 				And eat and drink, and carry to their homes

				 				Some gift, for gifts delight a servant’s heart.”



			 				Again Ulysses, the sagacious, spake:

				 				“Swineherd Eumaeus, thou, while yet a child,

				 				Wert doubtless strangely tossed about the world,

				 				Far from thy kindred and thy native land.

				 				Now tell me, was the spacious town wherein

				 				Thy father and thy mother dwelt laid waste?

				 				Or wert thou left among the flocks and herds

				 				Untended, and borne off by hostile men,

				 				Who came in ships and sold thee to the lord

				 				Of these possessions for a worthy price?”



			 				And then the master swineherd spake again:

				 				“Since thou dost ask me, stranger, hear my words

				 				In silence; sit at ease and drink thy wine.

				 				These nights are very long; there’s time enough

				 				For sleep, and time to entertain ourselves

				 				With talk. It is not fitting to lie down

				 				Ere the due hour arrive, and too much sleep

				 				Is hurtful. Whosoever here shall feel

				 				The strong desire, let him withdraw and sleep,

				 				And rise with early morn and break his fast,

				 				And tend my master’s swine. Let us remain

				 				Within, and drink and feast, and pass the time

				 				Gayly, relating what we have endured,

				 				Each one of us; for in the after time

				 				One who has suffered much and wandered far

				 				May take a pleasure even in his griefs.



			 				“But let me tell what thou hast asked of me:

				 				Beyond Ortygia lies an island named

				 				Syria; thou must have heard of it. The sun

				 				Above it turns his course. It is not large,

				 				But fruitful, fit for pasturage, and rich

				 				In flocks, abounding both in wine and wheat.

				 				There never famine comes, nor foul disease

				 				Fastens on wretched mortals; but when men

				 				Grow old, Apollo of the silver bow

				 				Comes with Diana, aims his silent shafts,

				 				And slays them. There two cities stand, and share

				 				The isle between them. There my father reigned,

				 				The godlike Ctesias, son of Ormenus,

				 				And both the cities owned him as their king.



			 				“There came a crew of that seafaring race,

				 				The people of Phoenicia, to our isle.

				 				Shrewd fellows they, and brought in their black ship

				 				Large store of trinkets. In my father’s house

				 				Was a Phoenician woman, large and fair,

				 				And skilful in embroidery. As she came

				 				A laundress to their ship, those cunning men

				 				Seduced her. One of them obtained her love﻿—

				 				For oft doth love mislead weak womankind,

				 				Even of the more discreet. Her paramour

				 				Asked who she was, and whence. She pointed out

				 				The lofty pile in which my father dwelt.



			 				“ ‘At Sidon, rich in brass, I had my birth﻿—

				 				A daughter of the opulent Arybas;

				 				And once, as I was coming from the fields,

				 				The Taphian pirates seized and bore me off,

				 				And brought me to this isle and sold me here,

				 				At that man’s house; much gold he paid for me.’



			 				“Then said her paramour: ‘Wilt thou not then

				 				Return with us, that thou mayst see again

				 				Father and mother, and their fair abode?

				 				For yet they live, and rumor says are rich.’



			 				“To this the woman answered: ‘I consent

				 				If first ye take an oath﻿—ye mariners﻿—

				 				And pledge your faith to bear me safely home.’



			 				“She spake, and they complied, and when the oath

				 				Was duly taken, thus the woman said:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Now hold your peace; let none of all the crew

				 				Speak to me more, in meeting on the road

				 				Or at the fountain, lest someone should tell

				 				The old man at the house, and he suspect

				 				Some fraud and bind me fast, and plot your death.

				 				Lock up your words within your breast; make haste

				 				To buy supplies, and when the ship is full

				 				Of all things needful, let a messenger

				 				Come to me at the palace with all speed;

				 				And I will bring with me whatever gold

				 				My hands may find, and something else to pay

				 				My passage. I am nurse to the young heir

				 				Of the good man who dwells in yonder halls﻿—

				 				A shrewd boy for his years, who oft goes out

				 				With me﻿—and I will lead him to the ship,

				 				And he will bring, in any foreign land

				 				To which ye carry him, a liberal price.’



			 				“The woman spake, and to our fair abode

				 				Departed. The Phoenician crew remained

				 				Until the twelvemonth’s end, and filled their ship

				 				With many things, and, when its roomy hull

				 				Was fully laden, sent a messenger

				 				To tell the woman. He, a cunning man,

				 				Came to my father’s house, and brought with him

				 				A golden necklace set with amber beads.

				 				The palace maidens and the gracious queen,

				 				My mother, took it in their hands, and gazed

				 				Upon it, and debated of its price.

				 				Meantime the bearer gave the sign, and soon

				 				Departed to the ship. The woman took

				 				My hand and led me forth. Within the hall

				 				She found upon the tables ready placed

				 				The goblets for my father’s guests, his peers;

				 				But they were absent, and in council yet

				 				Amid a great assembly. She concealed

				 				Three goblets in her bosom, and bore off

				 				The theft. I followed thoughtlessly. The sun

				 				Went down, and darkness brooded o’er the ways.

				 				Briskly we walked, and reached the famous port

				 				And the fast-sailing ship. They took us both

				 				On board, and sailed. Along its ocean path

				 				The vessel ran, and Jupiter bestowed

				 				A favorable wind. Six days we sailed,

				 				Both night and day; but when Saturnian Jove

				 				Brought the seventh day, Diana, archer-queen,

				 				Struck down the woman, and with sudden noise

				 				Headlong she plunged into the hold, as dives

				 				A seagull. But the seamen cast her forth

				 				To fishes and to sea-calves. I was left

				 				Alone and sorrowful. The winds and waves

				 				Carried our galley on to Ithaca;

				 				And there Laertes purchased me, and thus

				 				I first beheld the land in which I dwell.”



			 				And then again the great Ulysses spake:

				 				“Eumaeus, the sad story of thy wrongs

				 				And sufferings moves me deeply; yet hath Jove

				 				Among thy evil fortunes given this good,

				 				That, after all thy sufferings, thou art lodged

				 				With a good master, who abundantly

				 				Provides thee meat and drink; thou leadest here

				 				A pleasant life, while I am corae to thee

				 				From wandering long and over many lands.”



			 				So talked they with each other. No long time

				 				They passed in sleep, for soon the Morning came,

				 				Throned on her car of gold. Beside the shore

				 				The comrades of Telemachus cast loose

				 				The sails, took down the mast, and with their oars

				 				Brought in the vessel to its place. They threw

				 				The anchors out and bound the hawsers fast,

				 				And went upon the sea-beach, where they dressed

				 				Their morning meal, and mingled purple wine.

				 				Then, when the calls of thirst and hunger ceased,

				 				Discreet Telemachus bespake the crew:﻿—



			 				“Take the black ship to town. I visit first

				 				The fields, and see my herdsmen, and at eve

				 				Will come to town. Tomorrow I will give

				 				The parting feast, rich meats and generous wine.”



			 				Then said the godlike Theoclymenus:

				 				“Whither, my son, am I to go? What house

				 				Of all the chiefs of rugged Ithaca

				 				Shall I seek shelter in? with thee, perhaps,

				 				In thine own palace where thy mother dwells.”



			 				And thus discreet Telemachus replied:

				 				“I would have asked thee at another time

				 				To make our house thy home, for there would be

				 				No lack of kindly welcome. ’Twere not well

				 				To ask thee now, for I shall not be there,

				 				Nor will my mother see thee﻿—since not oft

				 				Doth she appear before the suitor-train,

				 				But in an upper room, apart from them,

				 				Weaves at her loom a web. Another man

				 				I name, Eurymachus, the illustrious son

				 				Of the sage Polybus, to be thy host.

				 				The noblest of the suitors he, and seeks

				 				Most earnestly to wed the queen, and take

				 				The rank Ulysses held. Olympian Jove,

				 				Who dwells in ether, knows the fatal day

				 				That may o’ertake the suitors ere she wed.”



			 				As thus he spake, a falcon on the right

				 				Flew by, Apollo’s messenger. A dove

				 				Was in his talons, which he tore, and poured

				 				The feathers down between Telemachus

				 				And where the galley lay. When this was seen

				 				By Theoclymenus, he called the youth

				 				Apart, alone, and took his hand and said:﻿—



			 				“The bird that passed us, O Telemachus,

				 				Upon the right, flew not without a god

				 				To guide him. When I saw it, well I knew

				 				The omen. Not in Ithaca exists

				 				A house of a more kingly destiny

				 				Than thine, and ever will its power prevail.”



			 				And thus discreet Telemachus replied:

				 				“O stranger, may thy saying come to pass;

				 				Then shalt thou quickly know me for thy friend,

				 				And be rewarded with such liberal gifts

				 				That all who meet thee shall rejoice with thee.”



			 				Then turning to Piraeus he bespake

				 				That faithful follower thus: “Pirseus, son

				 				Of Clytius, thou who ever wert the first

				 				To move, at my command, of all the men

				 				Who went with me to Pylos, take, I pray,

				 				This stranger to thy house, and there provide

				 				For him, and honor him until I come.”



			 				Piraeus, mighty with the spear, replied:

				 				“Telemachus, however long thy stay,

				 				This man shall be my guest, nor ever lack

				 				Beneath my roof for hospitable care.”



			 				He spake, and climbed the deck, and bade his men

				 				Enter the ship and cast the fastenings loose.

				 				Quickly they came together, went on board

				 				And manned the benches, while Telemachus

				 				Bound the fair sandals to his feet, and took

				 				His massive spear with its sharp blade of brass

				 				That lay upon the deck. The men unbound

				 				The hawsers, shoved the galley forth, and sailed

				 				Townward, as they were bidden by the son

				 				Of great Ulysses. Meantime the quick feet

				 				Of the young chieftain bore him on until

				 				He reached the lodge where his great herds of swine

				 				Were fed, and, careful of his master’s wealth,

				 				Beside his charge the worthy swineherd slept.

					Ulysses Discovering Himself to Telemachus


				 				Reception of Telemachus by Eumaeus, who is sent to inform Penelope of her son’s arrival﻿—interview of Ulysses and Telemachus, in which, at the command of Pallas, Ulysses discovers himself﻿—Return of the disappointed suitors from lying in wait for Telemachus.





				Meantime Ulysses and that noble hind

				 				The swineherd, in the lodge, at early dawn,

				 				Lighted a fire, prepared a meal, and sent

				 				The herdsmen forth to drive the swine afield.

				 				The dogs, so apt to bark, came fawning round,

				 				And barked not as Telemachus drew near.

				 				Ulysses heard the sound of coming feet,

				 				And marked the crouching dogs, and suddenly

				 				Bespake Eumaeus thus with winged words:﻿—



			 				“Eumaeus, without doubt some friend of thine,

				 				Or someone known familiarly, is near.

				 				There is no barking of the dogs; they fawn

				 				Around him, and I hear the sound of feet.”



			 				Scarce had he spoken, when within the porch

				 				Stood his dear son. The swineherd starting up,

				 				Surprised, let fall the vessels from his hands

				 				In which he mingled the rich wines, and flew

				 				To meet his master; kissed him on the brow;

				 				Kissed both his shining eyes and both his hands,

				 				With many tears. As when a father takes

				 				Into his arms a son whom tenderly

				 				He loves, returning from a distant land

				 				In the tenth year﻿—his only son, the child

				 				Of his old age, for whom he long has borne

				 				Hardship and grief﻿—so to Telemachus

				 				The swineherd clung, and kissed him o’er and o’er,

				 				As one escaped from death, and, shedding still

				 				Warm tears, bespake him thus with winged words:﻿—



			 				“Thou comest, O Telemachus! the light

				 				Is not more sweet to me. I never thought

				 				To see thee more when thou hadst once embarked

				 				For Pylos. Now come in, beloved child,

				 				And let my heart rejoice that once again

				 				I have thee here, so newly come from far.

				 				For ’tis not often that thou visitest

				 				Herdsmen and fields, but dwellest in the town﻿—

				 				Such is thy will﻿—beholding day by day

				 				The wasteful pillage of the suitor-train.”



			 				And thus discreet Telemachus replied:

				 				“So be it, father; for thy sake I came

				 				To see thee with these eyes, and hear thee speak

				 				And tell me if my mother dwells within

				 				The palace yet; or has some wooer led

				 				The queen away, his bride, and does the couch

				 				Of great Ulysses lie untapestried,

				 				With ugly cobwebs gathering over it?”



			 				And then the master swineherd spake in turn:

				 				“Most true it is that with a constant mind

				 				The queen inhabits yet thy palace halls,

				 				And wastes in tears her wretched nights and days.”



			 				So speaking he received his brazen lance,

				 				And over the stone threshold passed the prince

				 				Into the lodge. Ulysses yielded up

				 				His seat to him; Telemachus forbade.



			 				“Nay, stranger, sit; it shall be ours to find

				 				Elsewhere a seat in this our lodge, and he

				 				Who should provide it is already here.”



			 				He spake; Ulysses turned, and took again

				 				His place; the swineherd made a pile of twigs

				 				And covered it with skins, on which sat down

				 				The dear son of Ulysses. Next he brought

				 				Dishes of roasted meats which yet remained,

				 				Part of the banquet of the day before,

				 				And heaped the canisters with bread, and mixed

				 				The rich wines in a wooden bowl. He sat

				 				Right opposite Ulysses. All put forth

				 				Their hands and shared the meats upon the board;

				 				And when the calls of thirst and hunger ceased,

				 				Thus to the swineherd said Telemachus:﻿—



			 				“Whence, father, is this stranger, and how brought

				 				By seamen to the coast of Ithaca?

				 				And who are they that brought him?﻿—for I deem

				 				He came not over to our isle on foot.”



			 				And thus, Eumaeus, thou didst make reply:

				 				“True answer will I make to all. He claims

				 				To be a son of the broad isle of Crete,

				 				And says that in his wanderings he has passed

				 				Through many cities of the world, for so

				 				Some god ordained; and now, escaped by flight

				 				From a Thesprotian galley, he has sought

				 				A refuge in my lodge. Into thy hands

				 				I give him; deal thou with him as thou wilt.

				 				He is thy suppliant, and makes suit to thee.”



			 				Then spake discreet Telemachus again:

				 				“Eumaeus, thou hast uttered words that pierce

				 				My heart with pain; for how can I receive

				 				A stranger at my house? I am a youth

				 				Who never yet has trusted in his arm

				 				To beat the offerer of an insult back.

				 				And in my mother’s mind the choice is yet

				 				Uncertain whether to remain with me

				 				The mistress of my household, keeping still

				 				Her constant reverence for her husband’s bed,

				 				And still obedient to the people’s voice,

				 				Or whether she shall follow as a bride

				 				Him of the Achaian suitors in my halls

				 				Who is accounted worthiest, and who brings

				 				The richest gifts. Now, as to this thy guest,

				 				Since he has sought thy lodge, I give to him

				 				A cloak and tunic, seemly of their kind,

				 				A two-edged sword, and sandals for his feet.

				 				And I will send him to whatever coast

				 				He may desire to go. Yet, if thou wilt,

				 				Lodge him beneath thy roof, and I will send

				 				Raiment and food, that he may be no charge

				 				To thee or thy companions. To my house

				 				Among the suitor-train I cannot bear

				 				That he should go. Those men are insolent

				 				Beyond all measure; they would scoff at him,

				 				And greatly should I grieve. The boldest man

				 				Against so many might contend in vain,

				 				And greater is their power by far than mine.”



			 				Then spake Ulysses, the great sufferer:

				 				“O friend﻿—since I have liberty to speak﻿—

				 				My very heart is wounded when I hear

				 				What wrongs the suitors practise in thy halls

				 				Against a youth like thee. But give me leave

				 				To ask if thou submittest willingly,

				 				Or do thy people, hearkening to some god,

				 				Hate thee with open hatred? Dost thou blame

				 				Thy brothers?﻿—for in brothers men confide

				 				Even in a desperate conflict. Would that I

				 				Were young again, and with the will I have,

				 				Or that I could become Ulysses’ son,

				 				Or were that chief himself returned at last

				 				From all his wanderings﻿—and there yet is hope

				 				Of his return﻿—then might another strike

				 				My head off if I would not instantly

				 				Enter the house of Laertiades

				 				And make myself a mischief to them all.

				 				But should they overcome me, thus alone

				 				Contending with such numbers, I would choose

				 				Rather in mine own palace to be slain

				 				Than every day behold such shameful deeds﻿—

				 				Insulted guests, maidservants foully dragged

				 				Through those fair palace chambers, wine-casks drained,

				 				And gluttons feasting idly, wastefully,

				 				And others toiling for them without end.”



			 				Then spake again discreet Telemachus:

				 				“Stranger, thou shalt be answered faithfully.

				 				Know, then, the people are by no means wroth

				 				With me, nor have I brothers to accuse,

				 				Though in a desperate conflict men rely

				 				Upon a brother’s aid. Saturnian Jove

				 				Confines our lineage to a single head.

				 				The king Arcesius had an only son,

				 				Laertes, and to him was only born

				 				Ulysses; and Ulysses left me here,

				 				The only scion of his house, and he

				 				Had little joy of me. Our halls are filled

				 				With enemies, the chief men of the isles﻿—

				 				Dulichium, Samos, and Zacynthus dark

				 				With forests, and the rugged Ithaca﻿—

				 				So many woo my mother and consume

				 				Our substance. She rejects not utterly

				 				Their hateful suit, nor yet will give consent

				 				And end it. They go on to waste my wealth,

				 				And soon will end me also; but the event

				 				Rests with the gods.﻿—And go thou now with speed,

				 				Eumaeus, father, to Penelope,

				 				And say that I am safe, and just returned

				 				From Pylos. I remain within the lodge.

				 				And then come back as soon as thou hast told

				 				The queen alone. Let none of all the Greeks

				 				Hear aught; for they are plotting harm to me.”



			 				Then thus, Eumaeus, thou didst make reply:

				 				“Enough, I see it all, thy words are said

				 				To one who understands them. But, I pray,

				 				Direct me whether in my way to take

				 				A message to Laertes, the distressed.

				 				While sorrowing for Ulysses he o’ersaw

				 				The labors of the field, and ate and drank,

				 				As he had appetite, with those who wrought.

				 				But since thy voyage to the Pylian coast

				 				They say he never takes his daily meals

				 				As he was wont, nor oversees the work,

				 				But sits and mourns and sighs and pines away,

				 				Until his limbs are shrivelled to the bone.”



			 				Then spake discreet Telemachus again:

				 				“ ’Tis sad, but we must leave him to his grief

				 				A little while. Could everything be made

				 				To happen as we mortals wish, I then

				 				Would first desire my father’s safe return.

				 				But thou, when thou hast given thy message, haste

				 				Hither again, nor wander through the fields

				 				To him; but let my mother send at once

				 				The matron of her household, privately,

				 				To bear the tidings to the aged man.”



			 				He spake to speed the swineherd, who took up

				 				His sandals, bound them on, and bent his way

				 				Townward. Not unperceived by Pallas went

				 				Eumaeus from the lodge. She came in shape

				 				A woman beautiful and stately, skilled

				 				In household arts, the noblest. Near the gate

				 				She stood, right opposite. Ulysses saw;

				 				Telemachus beheld her not; the gods

				 				Not always manifest themselves to all.

				 				Ulysses and the mastiffs saw; the dogs

				 				Barked not, but, whimpering, fled from her and sought

				 				The stalls within. She beckoned with her brows;

				 				Ulysses knew her meaning and came forth,

				 				And passed the great wall of the court, and there

				 				Stood near to Pallas, who bespake him thus:﻿—



			 				“Son of Laertes, nobly born and wise,

				 				Speak with thy son; conceal from him the truth

				 				No longer, that, prepared to make an end

				 				Of that vile suitor-crew, ye may go up

				 				Into the royal town. Nor long will I

				 				Be absent; I am ready for the assault.”



			 				Thus spake the goddess. Putting forth a wand

				 				Of gold, she touched the chief. Beneath that touch

				 				His breast was covered with a new-blanched robe

				 				And tunic. To his frame it gave new strength;

				 				His swarthy color came again, his cheeks

				 				Grew full, and the beard darkened on his chin.

				 				This done, she disappeared. Ulysses came

				 				Into the lodge again; his son beheld

				 				Amazed and overawed, and turned his eyes

				 				Away, as if in presence of a god,

				 				And thus bespake the chief with winged words:﻿—



			 				“O stranger, thou art other than thou wert;

				 				Thy garb is not the same, nor are thy looks;

				 				Thou surely art some deity of those

				 				Whose habitation is the ample heaven.

				 				Be gracious to us, let us bring to thee

				 				Such sacrifices as thou wilt accept

				 				And gifts of graven gold; be merciful.”



			 				Ulysses, the great sufferer, thus replied:

				 				“I am no god; how am I like the gods?

				 				I am thy father, he for whom thy sighs

				 				Are breathed, and sorrows borne, and wrongs endured.”



			 				He spake and kissed his son, and from his lids

				 				Tears fell to earth, that long had been restrained.

				 				And then Telemachus, who could not think

				 				The stranger was his father, answered thus:﻿—



			 				“Nay, thou art not my father, thou art not

				 				Ulysses; rather hath some deity

				 				Sought to deceive me, that my grief may be

				 				The sharper; for no mortal man would do

				 				What has been done, unless some god should come

				 				To aid him, and to make him young or old

				 				At pleasure; for thou wert a moment since

				 				An aged man, and sordidly arrayed,

				 				And now art like the gods of the wide heaven.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:

				 				“It is not well, Telemachus, to greet

				 				With boundless wonder and astonishment

				 				Thy father in this lodge. Be sure of this,

				 				That no Ulysses other than myself

				 				Will ever enter here. I, who am he,

				 				Have suffered greatly and have wandered far,

				 				And in the twentieth year am come again

				 				To mine own land. Thou hast beheld today

				 				A wonder wrought by Pallas, huntress-queen,

				 				Who makes me what she will, such power is hers﻿—

				 				Sometimes to seem a beggar, and in turn

				 				A young man in a comely garb. The gods

				 				Whose home is in the heavens can easily

				 				Exalt a mortal man, or bring him low.”



			 				He spake and sat him down. Telemachus

				 				Around his glorious father threw his arms,

				 				And shed a shower of tears. Both felt at heart

				 				A passionate desire to weep; they wept

				 				Aloud﻿—and louder were their cries than those

				 				Of eagles, or the sharp-clawed vulture tribe,

				 				Whose young the hinds have stolen, yet unfledged.

				 				Still flowed their tears abundantly; the sun

				 				Would have gone down and left them weeping still

				 				Had not Telemachus at length inquired:﻿—



			 				“Dear father, tell me in what galley came

				 				The mariners who brought thee. Of what race

				 				Claim they to be? For certainly, I think,

				 				Thou cam’st not hither travelling on foot.”



			 				Ulysses, the great sufferer, thus replied:

				 				“My son, thou shalt be answered faithfully.

				 				Men of a race renowned for seamanship,

				 				Phaeacians, brought me hither. They convey

				 				Abroad the strangers coming to their isle,

				 				And, bearing me in one of their swift barques

				 				Across the sea, they landed me asleep

				 				In Ithaca. Rich were the gifts they gave﻿—

				 				Much brass and gold, and garments from the loom;

				 				These, so the gods have counselled, lie concealed

				 				Among the hollow rocks, and I am come,

				 				Obeying Pallas, to consult with thee

				 				How to destroy our enemies. Give now

				 				The number of the suitors; let me know

				 				How many there may be, and who they are,

				 				That with a careful judgment I may weigh

				 				The question whether we shall fall on them﻿—

				 				We two alone﻿—or must we seek allies.”



			 				Then spake discreet Telemachus again:

				 				“O father, I have heard of thy great fame

				 				My whole life long﻿—how mighty is thy arm,

				 				How wise thy counsels. Thou hast said great things,

				 				And I am thunderstruck. It cannot be

				 				That two alone should stand before a crowd

				 				Of valiant men. They are not merely ten﻿—

				 				These suitors﻿—nor twice ten, but many more;

				 				Hear, then, their number. From Dulichium come

				 				Fifty and two, the flower of all its youth,

				 				With whom are six attendants. Samos sends

				 				Twice twelve, and twenty more Achaian chiefs

				 				Come from Zacynthus. Twelve from Ithaca;

				 				The noblest of the isle are these﻿—with whom

				 				Medon the herald comes﻿—a bard whose song

				 				Is heavenly﻿—and two servants skilled to spread

				 				The banquet. Should we in the palace halls

				 				Assault all these, I fear lest the revenge

				 				For all thy wrongs would end most bitterly

				 				And grievously for thee. Now, if thy thought

				 				Be turned to some ally, bethink thee who

				 				Will combat for us with a willing heart.”



			 				Again Ulysses, the great sufferer, spake:

				 				“Then will I tell thee; listen, and give heed.

				 				Think whether Pallas and her father, Jove,

				 				Suffice not for us. Need we more allies?”



			 				And then discreet Telemachus rejoined:

				 				“Assuredly the twain whom thou hast named

				 				Are mighty as allies; for though they sit

				 				On high among the clouds, they yet bear rule

				 				Both o’er mankind and o’er the living gods.”



			 				Once more Ulysses, the great sufferer, spake:

				 				“Not long will they avoid the fierce affray

				 				When in my halls the strength of war is tried

				 				Between me and the suitor crew. Now go

				 				With early morning to thy home, and there

				 				Mingle among the suitors. As for me,

				 				The swineherd afterward shall lead me hence

				 				To town, a wretched beggar seemingly,

				 				And very old. If there they scoff at me

				 				In mine own palace, let thy faithful heart

				 				Endure it, though I suffer; though they seize

				 				My feet, and by them drag me to the door,

				 				Or strike at me with weapon-blades, look on

				 				And bear it; yet reprove with gentle words

				 				Their folly. They will never heed reproof;

				 				The day of their destruction is at hand.

				 				And this I tell thee further, and be sure

				 				To keep my words in memory. As soon

				 				As Pallas, goddess of wise counsel, gives

				 				The warning, I shall nod to thee, and thou,

				 				When thou perceivest it, remove at once

				 				All weapons from my halls to a recess

				 				High in an upper chamber. With soft words

				 				Quiet the suitors when they ask thee why.

				 				Say, ‘I would take them where there comes no smoke,

				 				Since now they seem no longer like to those

				 				Left by Ulysses when he sailed for Troy,

				 				But soiled and tarnished by the breath of fire.

				 				This graver reason, also, Saturn’s son

				 				Hath forced upon my mind﻿—that ye by chance,

				 				When full of wine and quarrelling, may wound

				 				Each other, and disgrace the feast, and bring

				 				Shame on your wooing; for the sight of steel

				 				Draws men to bloodshed.’ Say but this, and leave

				 				Two swords for us, two spears, two oxhide shields,

				 				Against the day of combat. Pallas then,

				 				And Jove the All-disposer, will unman

				 				Their hearts. Moreover, let me say to thee﻿—

				 				And keep my words in memory﻿—if thou be

				 				My son, and of my blood, let no man hear

				 				That now Ulysses is within the isle;

				 				Let not Laertes hear of it, nor him

				 				Who keeps the swine, nor any of the train

				 				Of servants, nor Penelope herself,

				 				While thou and I alone search out and prove

				 				The women of the household, and no less

				 				The serving-men, to know who honors us,

				 				And bears us reverence in his heart, and who

				 				Contemns us, and dishonors even thee.”



			 				Then answered his illustrious son and said:

				 				“Father, thou yet wilt know my heart, and find

				 				That of a careless and too easy mood

				 				I am not; but a search like this, I think,

				 				Would profit neither of us, and I pray

				 				That thou wilt well consider it. Long time

				 				Wouldst thou go wandering from place to place,

				 				O’er thy estates, to prove the loyalty

				 				Of everyone, while in thy halls at ease

				 				The suitors wastefully consume thy wealth.

				 				Yet would I counsel that the women’s faith

				 				Be proved, that the disloyal may be marked

				 				And the innocent go free. As for the men,

				 				I would not now inquire from farm to farm;

				 				That may be done hereafter, if indeed

				 				Thou hast a sign from aegis-bearing Jove.”



			 				So talked they with each other. The good ship

				 				Which brought Telemachus and all his friends

				 				From Pylos kept meantime upon its way

				 				To Ithaca. There, entering the deep port,

				 				The seamen hauled the black ship up the beach;

				 				And then the ready servants took away

				 				The arms, and to the house of Clytius bore

				 				The costly gifts. A herald from the ship

				 				Went forward to the palace of the king

				 				With tidings to the sage Penelope

				 				That now her son was come and in the fields,

				 				And that the ship at his command had reached

				 				The city, lest the royal dame might feel

				 				Fear for his safety, and give way to tears.

				 				The herald and the noble swineherd met,

				 				Each bearing the same message to the queen.

				 				Entering the palace of the godlike king,

				 				And standing midst the maids, the herald said:﻿—



			 				“O lady, thy beloved son is come.”

				 				But close beside the queen the swineherd stood,

				 				And told her everything which her dear son

				 				Had bid him say; and, having thus fulfilled

				 				His errand, left the palace and its court.



			 				Then were the suitors vexed and sorrowful,

				 				And going from the palace, and without

				 				The great wall that enclosed the court, sat down

				 				Before the gates, and there Eurymachus,

				 				The son of Polybus, harangued the throng:﻿—



			 				“Behold, my friends, Telemachus has done

				 				A marvellous thing; this voyage, which we thought

				 				He could not make, is made. Now let us launch

				 				A ship, the best that we can find, and man

				 				With fishermen the benches, sending it

				 				To find our friends, and hasten their return.”



			 				Scarce had he spoken when Amphinomus,

				 				In turning where he stood, beheld a barque

				 				Enter the port’s deep waters, with a crew

				 				That furled the sails and held the oars in hand.

				 				He laughed, well pleased, and to the suitors said:﻿—



			 				“There needs no message to be sent, for they

				 				Are here already. Haply hath some god

				 				Given them the knowledge, or perchance they saw,

				 				But could not overtake, the prince’s ship.”



			 				He spake; they rose and hastened to the strand,

				 				And quickly drew the galley up the beach.

				 				The ready servants bore the arms away;

				 				Then met they all in council, suffering none

				 				Save of the suitor-train to meet with them﻿—

				 				None, either young or old. Eupeithes’ son,

				 				Antinoüs, standing forth, bespake them thus:﻿—



			 				“How strangely do the gods protect this man

				 				From evil! All day long spy after spy

				 				Has sat and watched upon the airy heights,

				 				And when the sun was set we never slept

				 				On land, but ever in our gallant ship

				 				Sailed, waiting for the holy morn, and lay

				 				In constant ambush for Telemachus,

				 				To seize and to destroy him. Yet behold,

				 				Some deity has brought him home. And now

				 				Frame we a plan to cut off utterly

				 				Telemachus, and leave him no escape;

				 				For certainly I think that while he lives

				 				The end we aim at cannot be attained.

				 				Shrewd is the youth in counsel and device,

				 				And we no longer have, as once we had,

				 				The people’s favor. Let us quickly act,

				 				Ere he can call a council of the Greeks.

				 				That he will do without delay, and there

				 				Will rise in wrath to tell them how we planned

				 				His death by violence, and failed; and they

				 				Who hear assuredly will not approve

				 				The plotted mischief. They may drive us forth

				 				With outrage from our country to a land

				 				Of strangers. Let us be the first to strike,

				 				And slay him in the fields or on the way,

				 				And, taking his possessions to ourselves,

				 				Share equally his wealth. Then may we give

				 				This palace to his mother, and the man

				 				Whom she shall wed, whoever he may be.

				 				Or if this plan mislike you, and ye choose

				 				That he should live, and keep the fair estate

				 				That was his father’s, let us not go on

				 				Thronging the palace to consume his wealth

				 				In revelry, but each with liberal gifts

				 				Woo her from his own dwelling; and let him

				 				Who gives most generously, and whom fate

				 				Most favors, take the lady as his bride.”



			 				He spake, and all were mute. Amphinomus,

				 				The illustrious son of royal Nisus, rose.

				 				The grandson of Aretias, it was he

				 				Who led the suitors from Dulichium’s fields,

				 				Grassy and rich in corn. Penelope

				 				Liked best his words, for generous was his thought,

				 				And with a generous purpose thus he spake:﻿—



			 				“Nay, friends, not mine is the advice to slay

				 				Telemachus. It is a fearful thing

				 				To take a royal life. Then let us first

				 				Inquire the pleasure of the gods. For if

				 				The oracles of mighty Jupiter

				 				Approve it, I would do the deed myself,

				 				Or bid another do it; but if they

				 				Consent not, ’tis my counsel to forbear.”



			 				He spake, and all approved. At once they rose,

				 				And, entering the palace, sat them down

				 				On shining thrones. Meantime Penelope

				 				Had formed the purpose to appear before

				 				The arrogant suitors, for the news was brought

				 				Into her chamber of the plot to slay

				 				Her son; the herald Medon overheard,

				 				And told her all. So to the hall she went

				 				With her attendant maids. The glorious dame

				 				Drew near the suitor-train, and took her stand

				 				Beside a column of the stately pile,

				 				And with a delicate veil before her cheeks

				 				Began to speak, and chid Antinoüs thus:﻿—



			 				“Antinoüs, mischief-plotter, insolent!

				 				The rumor is that thou excellest all

				 				Of thy own age among the Ithacans

				 				In understanding and in speech. Yet such

				 				Thou never wert. Ferocious as thou art,

				 				Why seek the death of my Telemachus,

				 				And treat with scorn the suppliants of whose prayer

				 				Jove is the witness? An unholy thing

				 				It is when men against their fellow-men

				 				Plot mischief. Dost thou then forget that once

				 				Thy father came to us a fugitive,

				 				In terror of the people, who were wroth

				 				Because he joined the Taphian pirate-race,

				 				And plundered the Thesprotians, our allies.

				 				The people would have slain him, and have torn

				 				His heart out, and have pillaged his large wealth;

				 				Ulysses checked their rage, and held them back,

				 				Fierce as they were. Now thou dost waste his goods

				 				Most shamefully, and woo his wife, and slay

				 				His son, and multiply my woes. Cease now,

				 				I charge thee, and persuade the rest to cease.”



			 				Eurymachus, the son of Polybus,

				 				Replied: “O daughter of Icarius, sage

				 				Penelope, take heart; let no such thought

				 				Possess thy mind. There is no man on earth,

				 				Nor will there be, who shall lay violent hands

				 				Upon Telemachus, thy son, while I

				 				Am living, and yet keep the gift of sight.

				 				I say, and will perform it﻿—his black blood

				 				Shall flow and bathe my spear. Ulysses oft,

				 				Spoiler of realms, would take me on his knee,

				 				And put the roasted meats into my hands,

				 				And give me ruddy wine. I therefore hold

				 				Telemachus of all mankind most dear,

				 				And I will bid him have no fear of death

				 				From any of the suitors. If it come,

				 				Sent by the gods, he cannot then escape.”



			 				So spake he to appease her, while he planned,

				 				The murder of her son. The queen went up

				 				To the fair upper chambers, and there wept

				 				Ulysses, her dear spouse, till o’er her lids

				 				The blue-eyed Pallas poured the balm of sleep.



			 				At evening to Ulysses and his son

				 				The noble swineherd went, while busily

				 				They made the supper ready, having slain

				 				A porker one year old. Then instantly

				 				Stood Pallas by Ulysses, and put forth

				 				Her wand and touched him, making him again

				 				Old, and clad sordidly in beggar’s weeds,

				 				Lest that the swineherd, knowing at a look

				 				His master, might not keep the knowledge locked

				 				In his own breast, but, hastening forth, betray

				 				The secret to the chaste Penelope.



			 				Then to the swineherd said Telemachus:

				 				“Noble Eumaeus, welcome; what reports

				 				Are in the town? Have those large-minded men,

				 				The suitors, left their ambush and returned,

				 				Or are they waiting yet for me to pass?”



			 				And thus, Eumaeus, thou didst make reply:

				 				“Of that, indeed, I never thought to ask,

				 				In going through the town. My only care

				 				Was to return, as soon as I had given

				 				My message, with such speed as I could make.

				 				I met a messenger, a herald sent

				 				By thy companions, who was first to tell

				 				Thy mother of thy safe return. Yet this

				 				I know, for I beheld it with my eyes.

				 				When outside of the city, where the hill

				 				Of Hermes stands, I saw a gallant barque

				 				Entering the port, and carrying many men.

				 				Heavy it was with shields and two-edged spears;

				 				’Twas they, I thought, and yet I cannot tell.”



			 				He spake; Telemachus the valiant looked

				 				Upon his father with a smile unmarked

				 				By good Eumaeus. When their task was done,

				 				And the board spread, they feasted. No one lacked

				 				His portion of the common meal. Their thirst

				 				And hunger satisfied, they laid them down

				 				To rest, and so received the gift of sleep.





						Book 						XVII


					Return of Ulysses to His Palace


				 				Meeting of Telemachus and Penelope, Ulysses conducted by Eumaeus to the palace, where he is known by the dog Argus, who dies on seeing him﻿—Entrance of Ulysses among the suitors﻿—Assault made by Antinoüs upon Ulysses﻿—Ulysses sent for by Penelope.





				Now when the rosy-fingered Morn looked forth﻿—

				 				The daughter of the Dawn﻿—Telemachus,

				 				The dear son of the great Ulysses, bound

				 				The shapely sandals underneath his feet,

				 				And took the massive spear that fitted well

				 				His grasp, and, as he stood in act to go

				 				Up to the town, bespake the swineherd thus:﻿—



			 				“Father, I hasten to the town, that there

				 				My mother may behold me; for I think

				 				She will not cease to grieve, and fear, and weep,

				 				Till her eyes rest on me. I leave with thee

				 				The charge of leading our unfortunate guest

				 				Into the city, there to beg his bread.

				 				Whoever will may give him food and drink.

				 				All men I cannot feed, and I have cares

				 				Enough already. If he chafe at this,

				 				The worse for him. I like to speak my mind.”



			 				And thus Ulysses, the sagacious, spake:

				 				“Nor do I wish, my friend, to loiter here.

				 				Better it is for one like me to beg

				 				In town than in the country. In the town,

				 				Whoever chooses will bestow his dole;

				 				But here, if I remain about the stalls,

				 				I am no longer of an age to do

				 				All that a master may require. Go thou;

				 				This man, at thy command, will lead me hence,

				 				As soon as I have warmed me at the fire,

				 				And the air grows milder. This keen morning-cold

				 				May end me, and the way, ye say, is long.”



			 				He ended; from the lodge Telemachus

				 				Passed quickly, meditating to destroy

				 				The suitors. Coming to his stately home,

				 				He leaned his spear against a column’s shaft,

				 				And, crossing the stone threshold, entered in.

				 				First Eurycleia, who had been his nurse,

				 				Beheld him, as she spread the beautiful thrones

				 				With skins, and ran to him with weeping eyes;

				 				And round him other handmaids of the house

				 				Of resolute Ulysses thronged. They gave

				 				Fond welcome, kissing him upon the brow

				 				And shoulders. Issuing from her chamber next

				 				The chaste Penelope, like Dian’s self

				 				In beauty, or like golden Venus, came,

				 				And, weeping, threw her arms about her son,

				 				And kissed him on his forehead and on both

				 				His glorious eyes, and said, amidst her tears:﻿—



			 				“Light of my eyes! O my Telemachus!

				 				Art thou, then, come? I never thought again

				 				To see thee, when I heard thou hadst embarked

				 				For Pylos﻿—secretly, and knowing me

				 				Unwilling﻿—in the hope to gather there

				 				Some tidings of thy father. Tell me now

				 				All that has happened, all that thou hast seen.”



			 				And thus discreet Telemachus replied:

				 				“Nay, mother, waken not my griefs again,

				 				Nor move my heart to rage. I have just now

				 				Escaped a cruel death. But go and bathe,

				 				And put fresh garments on, and when thou com’st

				 				Into thy chamber with thy maidens, make

				 				A vow to all the gods that thou wilt burn

				 				A sacrifice of chosen hecatombs

				 				When Jupiter shall have avenged our wrongs.

				 				Now must I hasten to the marketplace

				 				In quest of one who came with me a guest

				 				From Pylos. Him, with all my faithful crew,

				 				I sent before me to this port, and bade

				 				Piraeus lead him to his own abode,

				 				There to be lodged and honored till I came.”



			 				He spake, nor flew his words unheeded by.

				 				The princess bathed, and put fresh garments on,

				 				And vowed to all the gods a sacrifice

				 				Of chosen hecatombs when Jupiter

				 				Should punish the wrongdoers. While she prayed,

				 				Telemachus went forth, his spear in hand.

				 				Two fleet dogs followed him. Minerva shed

				 				A godlike beauty o’er his form and face,

				 				And all the people wondered as he came.

				 				The suitors thronged around him with smooth words,

				 				Yet plotting mischief in their hearts. He turned

				 				From their assembly hastily, and took

				 				His place where Mentor sat with Antiphus,

				 				And Halitherses﻿—all his father’s friends

				 				And his from the beginning. While they asked

				 				Of all that he had seen, Piraeus came,

				 				The famous spearman, bringing through the town

				 				The stranger with him to the marketplace.

				 				Nor long Telemachus delayed, but came

				 				To meet his guest, and then Piraeus said:﻿—



			 				“Telemachus, despatch to where I dwell

				 				Thy serving-women; I would send to thee,

				 				At once, the gifts which Menelaus gave.”



			 				“And then discreet Telemachus replied:

				 				“We know not yet, Piraeus, what may be

				 				The event; and if the suitors privily

				 				Should slay me in the palace, and divide

				 				The inheritance among them, I prefer

				 				That thou, instead of them, shouldst have the gifts;

				 				But should they meet the fate which I have planned,

				 				And be cut off, then shalt thou gladly bring

				 				The treasures, which I gladly will receive.”



			 				So spake the prince, and to the palace led

				 				The unhappy man, his guest. When now they reached

				 				The stately pile, they both laid down their cloaks

				 				Upon the benches, and betook themselves

				 				To the well-polished baths. The attendant maids

				 				There ministered and smoothed their limbs with oil,

				 				And each received a tunic at their hands,

				 				And fleecy mantle. Then they left the baths

				 				And took their seats. A damsel came, and poured

				 				Water from a fair ewer wrought of gold

				 				Into a silver basin for their hands,

				 				And spread a polished table near their seats;

				 				And there the matron of the household placed

				 				Bread, and the many dishes which her stores

				 				Supplied. The queen was seated opposite,

				 				Beside a column of the pile, and twirled

				 				A slender spindle, while the son and guest

				 				Put forth their hands and shared the meal prepared.

				 				And when the calls of hunger and of thirst

				 				Had ceased, thus spake the sage Penelope:﻿—



			 				“Telemachus, when I again go up

				 				Into my chamber, I shall lay me down

				 				Upon the couch which, since Ulysses sailed

				 				For Troy with Atreus’ sons, has been to me

				 				A couch of mourning, sprinkled with my tears.

				 				And now thou hast not chosen to reveal,

				 				Ere yet the haughty suitors throng again

				 				Into these halls, what in thy voyage thou

				 				Hast haply heard concerning his return.”



			 				And thus discreet Telemachus replied:

				 				“Then, mother, will I truly tell thee all.

				 				We went to Pylos, and saw Nestor there,

				 				The shepherd of the people. Kindly he

				 				Received me in his stately home, as one

				 				Might welcome back a wandering son returned

				 				From foreign lands. Such welcome I received

				 				Both from the king and his illustrious sons.

				 				Put he had heard, he said, from living man,

				 				No tidings of the much-enduring chief

				 				Ulysses, whether he were yet alive

				 				Or dead. He therefore sent me with his steeds

				 				And chariot to the court of Atreus’ son,

				 				The warlike Menelaus. There I saw

				 				The Argive Helen, for whose sake the Greeks

				 				And Trojans, by the appointment of the gods,

				 				Suffered so much. The valiant king inquired

				 				What wish of mine had brought me to the town

				 				Of hallowed Lacedsemon. I replied,

				 				And truly told him all, and everything

				 				In order. Then he answered me, and said:﻿—



			 				“ ‘So then! these men, unwarlike as they are,

				 				Aspire to occupy a brave man’s bed,

				 				As when a hart hath left two suckling fawns,

				 				Just born, asleep in a strong lion’s lair,

				 				And roams for pasturage the mountain slopes

				 				And grassy lawns, the lion suddenly

				 				Comes back, and makes a cruel end of both,

				 				So will Ulysses bring a sudden doom

				 				Upon the suitors. Would to Father Jove,

				 				And Pallas, and Apollo, that the chief,

				 				Returning mighty, as he was when once

				 				In well-built Lesbos, at a wrestling-match,

				 				He rose to strive with Philomelides,

				 				And threw him heavily, and all the Greeks

				 				Rejoiced﻿—would he might come as then he was!

				 				Short-lived would then the suitors be, and taste

				 				A bitter marriage-feast. But now, to come

				 				To what thou hast inquired, I will not seek

				 				To turn from it, and talk of other things,

				 				Nor will deceive. Of all that I was told

				 				By the Ancient of the Deep, whose words are true,

				 				I will not hide a single word from thee.

				 				He saw thy father in an isle, he said,

				 				A prey to wasting sorrows, and detained,

				 				Unwilling, in the palace of the nymph

				 				Calypso. To the country of his birth

				 				He cannot come; no ships are there with oars

				 				And crew to bear him o’er the great wide sea.’



			 				“Thus Menelaus, mighty with the spear,

				 				The son of Atreus, said. And having now

				 				Fulfilled my errand, I returned. The gods

				 				Gave favoring winds, and sent me swiftly home.”



			 				He ended, and the queen was deeply moved.

				 				Then Theoclymenus, the godlike, said:﻿—



			 				“O gracious consort of Laertes’ son,

				 				King Menelaus knew not all. Hear now

				 				What I shall say﻿—for I will prophesy,

				 				And truly, nor will keep back aught from thee.

				 				Let Jupiter, the mightiest of the gods,

				 				And this thy hospitable board, and this

				 				The hearth of great Ulysses, where I find

				 				A refuge, be my witnesses, that now

				 				Ulysses is in his own land again,

				 				And sits or walks observant of the deeds

				 				Of wrong, and planning vengeance, yet to fall

				 				On all the suitors; such the augury

				 				Which I beheld when in the gallant barque

				 				I sat and told it to Telemachus.”



			 				And thus the sage Penelope replied:

				 				“O stranger! may thy saying be fulfilled!

				 				Then shalt thou have such thanks and such rewards

				 				That all who greet thee shall rejoice with thee.”



			 				So talked they with each other. In the space

				 				Before the palace of Ulysses stood

				 				The suitors, pleased with hurling quoits and spears

				 				On the smooth pavement, where their insolence

				 				So oft was seen. But when the supper-hour

				 				Was near, and from the fields the cattle came,

				 				Driven by the herdsmen, Medon﻿—he whom most

				 				They liked of all the heralds, and who sat

				 				Among them at the feast﻿—bespake them thus:﻿—



			 				“Youths! since ye now have had your pastime here,

				 				Come in, and help prepare the evening meal;

				 				At the due hour a banquet is not ill.”



			 				He spake; the suitors hearkened and obeyed,

				 				And rose, and came into the halls, and laid

				 				Their cloaks upon the benches and the thrones,

				 				And slaughtered well-fed sheep and fading goats,

				 				And made a victim of a pampered brawn,

				 				And a stalled ox, preparing for the feast.

				 				Meantime Ulysses and that noble hind

				 				The swineherd hastened to begin their walk

				 				To town, and thus the master swineherd spake:﻿—



			 				“Since, stranger, ’tis thy wish to pass today

				 				Into the city, as my master bade﻿—

				 				Though I by far prefer that thou remain

				 				A guardian of the stalls, yet much I fear

				 				My master, and am sure that he would chide,

				 				And harsh the upbraidings of a master are﻿—

				 				Let us depart; the day is now far spent,

				 				And chill will be the air of eventide.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:

				 				“Enough; I know; thy words are heard by one

				 				Who understands them. Let us then depart.

				 				Lead thou the way; and if thou hast a staff,

				 				Cut from the wood to lean on, give it me,

				 				Since, as thou say’st, we have a slippery road.”



			 				He spake, and o’er his shoulders flung a scrip,

				 				Old, cracked, and hanging by a twisted thong.

				 				Eumaeus gave the staff he asked, and both

				 				Went forth; the dogs and herdsmen stayed to guard

				 				The lodge. The swineherd led his master on

				 				Townward, a squalid beggar to the sight,

				 				And aged, leaning on a staff, and wrapped

				 				In sordid rags. There by the rugged way,

				 				As they drew near the town, they passed a fount

				 				Wrought by the hand of man, and pouring forth

				 				Its pleasant streams, from which the citizens

				 				Drew water. Ithacus and Neritus

				 				Founded it with Polyctor, and a grove

				 				Of alders feeding on the moistened earth

				 				Grew round it on all sides. The ice-cold rill

				 				Gushed from a lofty rock, upon whose brow

				 				An altar stood, at which the passersby

				 				Worshipped, and laid their offerings for the Nymphs.

				 				There did Melanthius, son of Dolius, meet

				 				The twain, as he was driving to the town

				 				The finest goats of all the flocks, to make

				 				A banquet for the suitors; with him went

				 				Two shepherds, following the flock. As soon

				 				As he beheld Eumaeus and his guest,

				 				He railed at them with rude and violent words,

				 				That made the anger of Ulysses rise.



			 				“See that vile fellow lead the vile about!

				 				Thus ever doth some god join like with like.

				 				Thou worthless swineherd! whither wouldst thou take

				 				This hungry, haunting beggar-man, this pest

				 				Of feasts, who at the posts of many a door

				 				Against them rubs his shoulders, asking crusts,

				 				Tripods or cauldrons never. Shouldst thou leave

				 				The wretch to me, to watch my stalls, and sweep

				 				The folds, and bring fresh branches to the kids,

				 				He might by drinking whey get stouter thighs.

				 				But he has learned no good, and will refuse

				 				To work; he better likes to stroll about

				 				With that insatiable stomach, asking alms

				 				To fill it. Let me tell thee what is sure

				 				To happen to him, should he ever come

				 				Into the palace of the glorious chief

				 				Ulysses. Many a footstool will be flung

				 				Around him by the hands of those who sit

				 				As guests, and they will tear the fellow’s sides.”



			 				He spake, and in his folly thrust his heel

				 				Against the hero’s thigh. The blow moved not

				 				Ulysses from his path, nor swerved he aught,

				 				But meditated whether with a blow

				 				Of his good staff to take the fellow’s life,

				 				Or lift him in the air and dash his head

				 				Against the ground. Yet he endured the affront

				 				And checked his wrath. The swineherd spake, and chid

				 				The offender, and thus prayed with lifted hands:﻿—



			 				“Nymphs of the fountain, born to Jupiter!

				 				If e’er in sacrifice Ulysses burned

				 				To you the thighs of lambs and goats, o’erlaid

				 				With fat, be pleased to grant the prayer I make,

				 				That, guided by some deity, the chief

				 				May yet return. Then thy rude boasts would cease.

				 				Melanthius, which thou utterest in thy way

				 				From place to place while wandering through the town.

				 				Unfaithful shepherds make a perishing flock.”



			 				Melanthius, keeper of the goats, rejoined:

				 				“ ’Tis wonderful how flippant is the cur,

				 				And shrewd! But I shall carry him on board

				 				A good black ship, far off from Ithaca,

				 				And there will sell him for a goodly price.

				 				Would that Apollo of the silver bow

				 				Might in the palace slay Telemachus

				 				This very hour, or that the suitors might,

				 				As certainly as that the day which brings

				 				Ulysses to his home will never dawn!”



			 				He spake, and left them there. They followed on

				 				Slowly. Melanthius hastened, and was soon

				 				At the king’s palace gate, and, entering, took

				 				A seat right opposite Eurymachus,

				 				Whose favorite he was. The attendants there

				 				Brought meats, the matron of the household bread,

				 				And both were set before them. Meantime stopped

				 				Ulysses with the noble swineherd near

				 				The palace, for around them in the air

				 				Came the sweet murmurs of a lyre. Just then

				 				Phemius, the minstrel, had begun his song,

				 				Ulysses took the swineherd’s hand, and said:﻿—



			 				“Eumaeus, this must be the noble pile

				 				In which Ulysses dwelt, for easily

				 				’Tis known among the others that are near.

				 				Rooms over rooms are here; around its court

				 				Are walls and battlements, and folding-doors

				 				Shut fast the entrance; no man may contemn

				 				Its strength. And I perceive that many guests

				 				Banquet within; the smoke of fat goes up,

				 				And the sweet lyre is heard; the gods have given

				 				Its music to accompany the feast.”



			 				And then, Eumaeus, thou didst make reply:

				 				“Thou speakest rightly, and in other things

				 				Thou art not slow of thought. Now let us think

				 				What we shall do. First enter, if thou wilt,

				 				The sumptuous rooms, while I remain without;

				 				Or, if it please thee, I will enter first,

				 				While thou remainest; yet delay not long,

				 				Lest someone, seeing thee, should deal a blow,

				 				Or drive thee hence. I pray thee, think of this.”



			 				Ulysses, the great sufferer, answered thus:

				 				“Enough; I know; thy words are heard by one

				 				Who understands them. Go before me, then,

				 				And leave me here. I am not quite unused

				 				To blows and stripes, and patient is my mood,

				 				For greatly have I suffered, both at sea

				 				And in the wars; and I submit to bear

				 				This also. But the stomach’s eagerness

				 				Is desperate, and is not to be withstood,

				 				And many are the mischiefs which it brings

				 				Upon the race of men; it fits out fleets

				 				That cross the barren deep arrayed for war,

				 				And carry death and woe to hostile realms.”



			 				So talked the twain. A dog was lying near,

				 				And lifted up his head and pricked his ears.

				 				’Twas Argus, which the much-enduring man

				 				Ulysses long before had reared, but left

				 				Untried, when for the hallowed town of Troy

				 				He sailed. The young men oft had led him forth

				 				In eager chase of wild goats, stags, and hares;

				 				But now, his master far away, he lay

				 				Neglected, just before the stable doors,

				 				Amid the droppings of the mules and beeves,

				 				Heaped high till carried to the spacious fields

				 				Of which Ulysses was the lord. There lay

				 				Argus, devoured with vermin. As he saw

				 				Ulysses drawing near, he wagged his tail

				 				And dropped his ears, but found that he could come

				 				No nearer to his master. Seeing this,

				 				Ulysses wiped away a tear unmarked

				 				By the good swineherd, whom he questioned thus:﻿—



			 				“Eumaeus, this I marvel at﻿—this dog,

				 				That lies upon the dunghill, beautiful

				 				In form, but whether in the chase as fleet

				 				As he is fairly shaped I cannot tell.

				 				Worthless, perchance, as house-dogs often are,

				 				Whose masters keep them for the sake of show.”



			 				And thus, Eumaeus, thou didst make reply:

				 				“The dog belongs to one who died afar.

				 				Had he the power of limb which once he had

				 				For feats of hunting when Ulysses sailed

				 				For Troy and left him, thou wouldst be amazed

				 				Both at his swiftness and his strength. No beast

				 				In the thick forest depths which once he saw,

				 				Or even tracked by footprints, could escape.

				 				And now he is a sufferer, since his lord

				 				Has perished far from his own land. No more

				 				The careless women heed the creature’s wants;

				 				For, when the master is no longer near,

				 				The servants cease from their appointed tasks,

				 				And on the day that one becomes a slave

				 				The Thunderer, Jove, takes half his worth away.”



			 				He spake, and, entering that fair dwelling-place,

				 				Passed through to where the illustrious suitors sat,

				 				While over Argus the black night of death

				 				Came suddenly as soon as he had seen

				 				Ulysses, absent now for twenty years.

				 				Telemachus, the godlike, was the first

				 				To mark the swineherd coming through the hall,

				 				And, nodding, called to him. The swineherd looked

				 				About him, and beheld a seat on which

				 				The carver of the feast was wont to sit,

				 				Distributing the meats. He bore it thence

				 				And placed it opposite Telemachus,

				 				And at his table. Then he sat him down,

				 				And thither came the herald, bringing him

				 				A portion of the feast, and gave him bread

				 				From the full canister. Soon after him

				 				Ulysses entered, seemingly an old

				 				And wretched beggar, propped upon a staff,

				 				And wrapped in sordid weeds. He sat him down

				 				On the ashen threshold, just within the doors,

				 				And leaned against a shaft of cypress-wood,

				 				Which some artificer had skilfully

				 				Wrought by a line, and smoothed. Telemachus

				 				Called to the swineherd, bade him come, and took

				 				A loaf that lay in the fair canister,

				 				And all the flesh which his two hands could grasp.



			 				“Bear this to yonder stranger; bid him go

				 				And ask a dole from every suitor here.

				 				No beggar should be bashful in his need.”



			 				He spake, the hind obeyed, and, drawing near

				 				Ulysses, said to him in winged words:﻿—



			 				“These from Telemachus, who bids thee ask

				 				A dole from every suitor, for he says

				 				No beggar should be bashful in his need.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:

				 				“May Jove, the sovereign, make Telemachus

				 				A happy man among the sons of men,

				 				And grant him all his heart desires in life!”



			 				He spake, and took the gift in both his hands,

				 				And laid it down upon his tattered scrip

				 				Close to his feet. Then, while the poet sang,

				 				He ate, and, just as he had supped, the bard

				 				Closed his divine recital. Then ensued

				 				Great clamor in the hall, but Pallas came

				 				And moved Ulysses to arise, and ask

				 				From every suitor there a dole of bread,

				 				That he might know the better from the worse,

				 				Though none were to be spared. From right to left

				 				He took his way, and asked of every man,

				 				With outstretched hand, as if he had been long

				 				A beggar. And they pitied him, and gave,

				 				And looked at him with wonder, and inquired

				 				One of another who he was, and whence.

				 				Then spake Melanthius, keeper of the goats:﻿—



			 				“Give ear, ye suitors of the illustrious queen.

				 				As to this stranger, I have seen him once.

				 				The swineherd brought him; but I know him not,

				 				And of what race he is I cannot tell.”



			 				He spake; Antinoüs chid the swineherd thus:

				 				“Why hast thou brought him, too well known thyself?

				 				Have we not vagabonds enough? enough

				 				Of sturdy beggars, pests of every feast.

				 				Or is it a light matter that they throng

				 				Hither to waste the substance of thy lord,

				 				And therefore thou art with this fellow here?”



			 				And thus, Eumaeus, thou didst make reply:

				 				“Antinoüs, high as is thy station, thou

				 				Hast spoken ill. What man goes ever forth

				 				To bid a stranger to his house, unless

				 				The stranger be of those whose office is

				 				To serve the people, be he seer, or leech,

				 				Or architect, or poet heaven-inspired,

				 				Whose song is gladly heard? All these are called

				 				To feasts wherever men are found; but none

				 				Call in the poor, to live upon their means.

				 				Antinoüs, thou, of all the suitor-train,

				 				Dost ever with the greatest harshness treat

				 				The servants of Ulysses, chiefly me.

				 				I heed it not while sage Penelope

				 				Dwells in the palace with her godlike son.”



			 				Then interposed discreet Telemachus:

				 				“Nay, have no strife of words with him, I pray.

				 				Antinoüs takes delight in bitter words,

				 				And rails, and stirs up railing in the rest.”

				 				And then he turned, and thus with winged words

				 				Bespake Antinoüs: “Truly thou dost care

				 				For me as might a father for a son,

				 				Bidding me drive a stranger from my door

				 				With violent words﻿—which God forbid. Take now

				 				Somewhat and give to him. I grudge it not,

				 				Nay, I advise it. Fear not to offend

				 				My mother, or displease a single one

				 				Of all the household of the godlike chief,

				 				Ulysses. But thou hast not thought of this.

				 				It suits thee best to feast and never give.”



			 				Antinoüs thus rejoined: “O utterer

				 				Of big and braggart words! Telemachus,

				 				If all the other suitors would bestow

				 				As much as I will, he would not be seen

				 				Within these halls for three months yet to come.”



			 				So speaking, he brought forward to the sight,

				 				From underneath the board, a stool, on which

				 				Rested his dainty feet. The others all

				 				Gave somewhat to Ulysses, till his scrip

				 				Was filled with meat and bread Then as he went

				 				Back to the threshold, there to feast on what

				 				The Greeks had given him in his rounds, he stopped

				 				Beside Antinoüs, and bespake him thus:﻿—



			 				“Give somewhat also, friend. Thou dost not seem

				 				One of the humbler rank among the Greeks,

				 				But of the highest. Kingly is thy look;

				 				It therefore will become thee to bestow

				 				More freely than the rest, and I will sound

				 				Thy praise through all the earth. Mine too was once

				 				A happy lot, for I inhabited

				 				A palace filled with goods, and often gave

				 				To wanderers, whosoever they might be

				 				That sought me out, and in whatever need.

				 				And I had many servants, and large store

				 				Of everything by which men live at ease

				 				And are accounted rich. Saturnian Jove﻿—

				 				Such was his pleasure﻿—brought me low; for, moved

				 				By him, I joined me to a wandering band

				 				Of pirates, and to my perdition sailed

				 				Upon a distant voyage to the coast

				 				Of Egypt. In the river of that land

				 				I stationed my good ships, and bade my men

				 				Remain with them and watch them well. I placed

				 				Sentries upon the heights. Yet confident

				 				In their own strength, and rashly giving way

				 				To greed, my comrades ravaged the fair fields

				 				Of the Egyptians, slew them, and bore off

				 				Their wives and little ones. The rumor reached

				 				The city soon; the people heard the alarm

				 				And came together. With the dawn of day

				 				All the great plain was thronged with horse and foot,

				 				And gleamed with brass, while Jove, the Thunderer, sent

				 				A deadly fear into our ranks, where none

				 				Dared face the foe. On every side was death.

				 				The Egyptians hew r ed down many with the sword,

				 				And some they led away alive to toil

				 				For them in slavery. Me my captors gave

				 				Into a stranger’s hands, upon his way

				 				To Cyprus, where he reigned, a mighty king,

				 				Demetor, son of Jasus. Thence at last

				 				I came through many hardships to this isle.”



			 				Antinoüs lifted up his voice, and said:

				 				“What god hath sent this nuisance to disturb

				 				The banquet? Take thyself to the mid-hall,

				 				Far from thy table, else expect to see

				 				An Egypt and a Cyprus of a sort

				 				That thou wilt little like. Thou art a bold

				 				And shameless beggar. Thou dost take thy round

				 				And ask from each, and foolishly they give,

				 				And spare not nor consider; well supplied

				 				Is each, and freely gives what is not his.”



			 				Then sage Ulysses said as he withdrew:

				 				“ ’Tis strange; thy mind agrees not with thy form.

				 				Thou wouldst not give a suppliant even salt

				 				In thine own house﻿—thou who, while sitting here

				 				Fed at another’s table, canst not bear

				 				To give me bread from thy well-loaded board.”



			 				He spake. Antinoüs grew more angry still,

				 				And frowned and answered him with winged words:﻿—



			 				“Dealer in saucy words! I hardly think

				 				That thou wilt leave this palace unchastised.”



			 				He spake, and raised the footstool in his hand,

				 				And smote Ulysses on the lower part

				 				Of the right shoulder. Like a rock he stood,

				 				Unmoved beneath the blow Antinoüs gave,

				 				But shook his head in silence as he thought

				 				Of vengeance. Then, returning, he sat down

				 				Upon the threshold, where he laid his scrip

				 				Well filled, and thus bespake the suitor-train:﻿—



			 				“Hear me, ye suitors of the illustrious queen.

				 				Grief or resentment no man feels for blows

				 				Received by him while fighting for his own﻿—

				 				His beeves or white-woolled sheep. But this man here,

				 				Antinoüs, dealt that blow on me because

				 				I have an empty stomach; hunger brings

				 				Great mischiefs upon men. If there be gods

				 				Or furies who avenge the poor, may death

				 				O’ertake Antinoüs ere his marriage-day!”



			 				He ended. Then again Eupeithes’ son,

				 				Antinoüs, spake: “Eat, stranger, quietly;

				 				Sit still, or get thee hence; our young men else

				 				Who hear thy words will seize thee by the feet

				 				Or hands, and drag thee forth and flay thee there.”



			 				He spake, and greatly were the rest incensed,

				 				And one of those proud youths took up the word:﻿—



			 				“Antinoüs, it was ill of thee to smite

				 				That hapless wanderer. Madman! what if he

				 				Came down from heaven and were a god! The gods

				 				Put on the form of strangers from afar,

				 				And walk our towns in many different shapes,

				 				To mark the good and evil deeds of men.”



			 				Thus spake the suitors, but he heeded not

				 				Their words. Telemachus, who saw the blow,

				 				Felt his heart swell with anger and with grief,

				 				Yet from his eyelids fell no tear; he shook

				 				His head in silence, pondering to repay

				 				The wrong. Meantime the sage Penelope

				 				Heard of the stranger smitten in her halls,

				 				And thus bespake the maidens of her train:﻿—



			 				“Would that Apollo, mighty with the bow,

				 				Might smite thee also!” Then Eurynomè,

				 				The matron of the household, said in turn:



			 				“O, were our prayers but heard, not one of these

				 				Should look upon the golden morn again!”



			 				Then spake again the sage Penelope:

				 				“Mother, they all are hateful; everyone

				 				Plots mischief, but Antinoüs most of all;

				 				And he is like black death, to be abhorred.

				 				A friendless stranger passes through these halls,

				 				Compelled by need, and asks an alms of each,

				 				And all the others give, and fill his scrip;

				 				Antinoüs flings a footstool, and the blow

				 				Bruises the shoulder of the suppliant man.”



			 				So talked they with each other where they sat

				 				In the queen’s chamber, mid the attendant train

				 				Of women, while meantime Ulysses took

				 				The evening meal. The queen then bade to call

				 				The noble swineherd, and bespake him thus:﻿—



			 				“My worthy friend Eumaeus, go and bring

				 				The stranger hither. I would speak with him,

				 				And ask if anywhere he saw or heard

				 				Aught of Ulysses; for he seems like one

				 				Whose wanderings have been in many lands.”



			 				And thus, Eumaeus, thou didst make reply:

				 				“Would that these Greeks, O queen, would hold their peace,

				 				Then might this stranger in thy hearing speak

				 				Words full of consolation. For three nights

				 				I had him with me, for three days I made

				 				My lodge his home﻿—for at the very first

				 				He came to me, escaping from his ship﻿—

				 				Nor when he left me had he told of all

				 				That he had suffered. As a hearer looks

				 				Upon a minstrel whom the gods have taught

				 				To sing the poems that delight all hearts,

				 				And, listening, longs to listen without end;

				 				So, as the stranger sat beneath my roof,

				 				He held me charmed. He was the ancestral friend,

				 				He said, of thy Ulysses, and his home

				 				Was Crete, where dwells the stock of Minos yet.

				 				From Crete he came, and much had suffered since,

				 				Driven on from place to place. And he had heard

				 				Some tidings of Ulysses yet alive﻿—

				 				So he affirmed﻿—in a rich region near

				 				The realm of the Thesprotians, and prepared

				 				To bring much riches to his native isle.”



			 				Then spake the sage Penelope again:

				 				“Go, call him hither, that he may relate

				 				His story in my presence. Let these men,

				 				As it may please them, sitting at our gates

				 				Or in our halls, amuse themselves, for light

				 				Are they of heart. Unwasted in their homes

				 				Lie their possessions, and their bread and wine

				 				Are only for their servants, while themselves

				 				Frequent our palace, day by day, and slay

				 				Our beeves and sheep and fatling goats, and feast,

				 				And drink abundantly the dark red wine,

				 				And all with lavish waste. No man is here,

				 				Such as Ulysses was, to drive away

				 				This pest from our abode. Should he return

				 				To his own land, he and his son would take

				 				Swift vengeance on the men who do him wrong.”



			 				She ended. Suddenly Telemachus

				 				Sneezed loudly, so that all the palace rang;

				 				And, laughing as she heard, Penelope

				 				Bespake Eumaeus thus with winged words:﻿—



			 				“Go, call the stranger. Dost thou not perceive

				 				My son has sneezed as to confirm my words.

				 				Not unfulfilled will now remain the doom

				 				That waits the suitors; none will now escape

				 				Death and the Fates. This further let me say,

				 				And thou remember it; if what he tells

				 				Be true, I will bestow on him a change

				 				Of fair attire, a tunic and a cloak.”



			 				She spake, the swineherd went, and, drawing near

				 				Ulysses, said to him in winged words:﻿—



			 				“Stranger and father, sage Penelope,

				 				The mother of the prince, hath sent for thee.

				 				Though sorrowing, she is minded to inquire

				 				What of her husband thou canst haply say;

				 				And should she find that all thy words are true,

				 				She will bestow a tunic and a cloak,

				 				Garments which much thou needest. For thy food,

				 				What will appease thy hunger thou wilt find

				 				Among the people; ask, and each will give.”



			 				Ulysses, much-enduring man, replied:

				 				“Eumaeus, faithfully will I declare

				 				All that I know to sage Penelope,

				 				The daughter of Icarius. Well I knew

				 				Her husband, and with like calamities

				 				We both have suffered. But I greatly dread

				 				This reckless suitor-crew, whose riotous acts

				 				And violence reach to the iron heavens.

				 				Even now, when that man dealt me, as I passed,

				 				A painful blow, though I had done no harm,

				 				None interposed, not even Telemachus,

				 				In my defence. Now, therefore, ask, I pray,

				 				Penelope that she will deign to wait

				 				Till sunset in her rooms, though strong her wish

				 				To hear my history. Of her husband then,

				 				And his return, she may inquire, while I

				 				Sit by the blazing hearth; for scant have been

				 				My garments, as thou knowest, since the day

				 				When first I came, a suppliant, to thy door.”



			 				He spake; the swineherd went, and as he crossed

				 				The threshold of Penelope she said:﻿—



			 				“Thou bringst him not, Eumaeus? What may be

				 				The wanderer’s scruple? Fear of someone here?

				 				Or in a palace is he filled with awe?

				 				To be a bashful beggar is most hard.”



			 				And thus, Eumaeus, thou didst answer her:

				 				“Rightly he speaks, and just as one would think

				 				Who shuns the encounter of disorderly men.

				 				He prays that thou wilt wait till set of sun;

				 				And better were it for thyself, O queen,

				 				To speak with him and hear his words alone.”



			 				Then spake discreet Penelope again:

				 				“Whoe’er may be the stranger, not unwise

				 				He seems; for nowhere among men are done

				 				Such deeds of wrong and outrage as by these.”



			 				She spake, and the good swineherd, having told

				 				The lady all, went forth among the crowd

				 				Of suitors, drawing near Telemachus,

				 				And bowed his head beside him that none else

				 				Might hear, and said to him in winged words:﻿—



			 				“I go, my friend, to tend the swine and guard

				 				What there thou hast, thy sustenance and mine.

				 				The charge of what is here belongs to thee.

				 				Be thy first care to save thyself, and watch

				 				To see that mischief overtake thee not﻿—

				 				For many are the Achaians plotting it,

				 				Whom Jove destroy ere we become their prey!”



			 				Then spake discreet Telemachus in turn:

				 				“So be it, father, and, when thou hast supped,

				 				Depart, but with the morning come, and bring

				 				Choice victims for the sacrifice. The care

				 				Of all things here is with the gods and me.”



			 				He spake; the swineherd sat him down again

				 				Upon his polished seat, and satisfied

				 				His appetite and thirst with food and wine.

				 				Then he departed to his herd, and left

				 				The palace and the court before it thronged

				 				With revellers, who gave the hour to song,

				 				And joined the dance; for evening now was come.

					Combat of Ulysses and Iris


				 				Ulysses insulted by the beggar Irus﻿—Amusement of the suitors, who encourage the quarrel﻿—Victory of Ulysses in the combat with Irus﻿—Manoeuvre of Penelope to obtain presents from the suitors, and its success﻿—Ulysses insulted by Eurymachus﻿—His reply﻿—The cupbearer struck down by a footstool flung at Ulysses by Eurymachus.





				There came a common beggar, wont to ask

				 				Alms through the town of Ithaca, well known

				 				For greediness of stomach, gluttonous

				 				And a wine-bibber, but of little strength

				 				And courage, though he seemed of powerful mould.

				 				Arnaeus was the name which at his birth

				 				His mother gave him, but the young men called

				 				The fellow Irus, for it was his wont

				 				To go on errands, as a messenger,

				 				When he was ordered. Coming now, he thought

				 				To drive Ulysses out of his own house,

				 				And railed at him, and said in winged words:﻿—



			 				“Hence with thee! leave the porch, old man, at once,

				 				Lest thou be taken by the foot and dragged

				 				Away from it. Dost thou not see how all

				 				Around us nod, to bid me drag thee out?

				 				I am ashamed to do it. Rise and go,

				 				Else haply we may have a strife of blows.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, frowned and said:

				 				“Wretch! there is nothing that I do or say

				 				To harm thee aught. I do not envy thee

				 				What others give thee, though the dole be large;

				 				And ample is this threshold for us both.

				 				Nor shouldst thou envy others, for thou seemst

				 				A straggler like myself. The gods bestow

				 				Wealth where they list. But do not challenge me

				 				To blows, lest, aged as I am, thou rouse

				 				My anger, and I make thy breast and lips

				 				Hideous with blood. Tomorrow then will be

				 				A quiet day for me, since thou, I trust,

				 				In all the time to come, wilt never more

				 				Enter the palace of Laertes’ son.”



			 				The beggar Irus angrily rejoined:

				 				“Ye gods! this glutton prattles volubly,

				 				Like an old woman at the chimney-side.

				 				Yet could I do him mischief, smiting him

				 				On both his sides, and dashing from his cheeks

				 				The teeth to earth, as men are wont to deal

				 				With swine that eat the wheat. Now gird thyself,

				 				Let these men see us fighting. How canst thou

				 				Think to contend with one so young as I?”



			 				Thus fiercely did they wrangle as they stood

				 				Beside the polished threshold and before

				 				The lofty gates. The stout Antinoüs heard,

				 				And, laughing heartily, bespake the rest:﻿—



			 				“Here, friends, is what we never yet have had.

				 				Behold the pleasant pastime which the gods

				 				Provide for us. These men﻿—the stranger here,

				 				And Irus﻿—quarrel, and will come to blows.

				 				Let us stand by and bring the combat on.”



			 				He spake. All rose with laughter and came round

				 				The ragged beggars, while Eupeithes’ son,

				 				Antinoüs, in these words harangued the rest:﻿—



			 				“Ye noble suitors, hear me. At the fire

				 				Already lie the paunches of two goats,

				 				Preparing for our evening meal, and both

				 				Are filled with fat and blood. Whoever shows

				 				Himself the better man in this affray,

				 				And conquers, he shall take the one of these

				 				He chooses, and shall ever afterward

				 				Feast at our table, and no man but he

				 				Shall ever come among us asking alms.”



			 				He ended. All approved his words, and thus

				 				Ulysses, craftily dissembling, said:﻿—



			 				“O friends, it is not well that one so old

				 				As I, and broken by calamity,

				 				Should fight a younger man; but hunger bids,

				 				And I may be o’ercome by blows. But now

				 				Swear all a solemn oath, that none of you,

				 				To favor Irus, wickedly will raise

				 				His mighty hand to smite me, and so aid

				 				My adversary to my overthrow.”



			 				He spake; the suitor-train, assenting, took

				 				The oath, and when they all were duly sworn,

				 				The highborn prince Telemachus began:﻿—



			 				“O stranger, if thy manly heart be moved

				 				To drive him hence, fear no one else of all

				 				The Achaians. Whosoever strikes at thee

				 				Has many to contend with. I am here

				 				The host. Antinoüs and Eurymachus,

				 				Wise men and kings, agree with me in this.”



			 				He spake, and all approved. Ulysses drew

				 				And girt his tatters round his waist and showed

				 				His large and shapely thighs. Unclothed appeared

				 				His full broad shoulders, and his manly breast

				 				And sinewy arms. Minerva stood by him,

				 				And with a mighty breadth of limb endued

				 				The shepherd of the people. Earnestly

				 				The suitors gazed, and wondered at the sight,

				 				And each one, turning to his neighbor, said:﻿—



			 				“Irus, poor Irus, on himself has drawn

				 				An evil fate, for what a sinewy thigh

				 				His adversary shows beneath his rags!”



			 				So talked they, while the heart of Irus sank

				 				Within him; yet the attendants girding him

				 				Forcibly drew him forward, sore afraid,

				 				The muscles quivering over every limb.

				 				And then Antinoüs spake, and chid him thus:﻿—



			 				“Now, boaster, thou deservest not to live,

				 				Nay, nor to have been born, if thou dost fear

				 				And quake at meeting one so old as he,

				 				So broken with the hardships he has borne.

				 				And now I tell thee what will yet be done,

				 				Should he approve himself the better man,

				 				And conquer. I will have thee sent on board

				 				A galley to Epirus, and its king,

				 				The foe of all men living, Echetus,

				 				And he will pare away thy nose and ears

				 				With the sharp steel, and, wrenching out the parts

				 				Of shame, will cast them to be torn by dogs.”



			 				He spake, and Irus shook through all his frame

				 				With greater terror, yet they dragged him on

				 				Into the midst. Both champions lifted up

				 				Their arms. The godlike, much-enduring man,

				 				Ulysses, pondered whether so to strike

				 				His adversary that the breath of life

				 				Might leave him as he fell, or only smite

				 				To stretch him on the earth. As thus he mused,

				 				The lighter blow seemed wisest, lest the Greeks

				 				Should know who dealt it. When the hands of both

				 				Were thus uplifted, Irus gave a blow

				 				On his right shoulder, while Ulysses smote

				 				Irus beneath the ear, and broke the bone

				 				Within, and brought the red blood from his mouth.

				 				He fell amid the dust, and shrieked and gnashed

				 				His teeth, and beat with jerking feet the ground.

				 				The suitor-train threw up their hands and laughed

				 				Till breathless, while Ulysses seized his feet

				 				And drew him o’er the threshold to the court

				 				And the porch doors, and there, beside the wall,

				 				Set him to lean against it, gave a staff

				 				Into his hands, and said in winged words:﻿—



			 				“Sit there, and scare away the dogs and swine,

				 				But think not, wretched creature, to bear rule

				 				Over the stranger and the beggar tribe,

				 				Or worse than this may happen to thee yet.”



			 				He spake, and o’er his shoulders threw the scrip

				 				That yawned with chinks, and by a twisted thong

				 				Was fastened; then he turned to take his seat

				 				Upon the threshold, while the suitor-train

				 				Went back into the palace with gay shouts

				 				Of laughter, and bespake him blandly thus:﻿—



			 				“Stranger, may Jove and all the other gods

				 				Grant thee what thou desirest, and whate’er

				 				Is pleasant to thee! Thou hast put an end

				 				To this importunate beggar’s rounds among

				 				The people. We shall send him off at once

				 				Into Epirus, and to Echetus,

				 				Its king, the foe of every living man.”



			 				So talked the suitors, and the omen made

				 				Ulysses glad. Meantime Antinoüs placed

				 				The mighty paunch before the victor, filled

				 				sWith blood and fat, and from the canister

				 				Amphinomus brought forth two loaves, and raised

				 				A golden cup and drank to him, and said:﻿—



			 				“Hail, guest and father! happy be thy days

				 				Henceforth, though dark with many sorrows now!”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:

				 				“Amphinomus, thou seemest most discreet,

				 				And such thy father is, of whom I hear

				 				A worshipful report, the good and rich

				 				Dulichian Nisus. Thou, as I am told,

				 				Art son to him, and thou art seemingly

				 				A man of pertinent speech. I therefore say

				 				To thee, and bid thee hear and mark me well,

				 				No being whom earth nourishes to breathe

				 				Her air and move upon her face is more

				 				The sport of circumstance than man. For while

				 				The gods give health, and he is strong of limb,

				 				He thinks no evil in the coming days

				 				Will overtake him. When the blessed gods

				 				Visit him with afflictions, these he bears

				 				Impatiently and with a fretful mind.

				 				Such is the mood of man, while yet he dwells

				 				On earth; it changes as the All-Father gives

				 				The sunshine or withholds it. I was once

				 				Deemed fortunate among my fellow-men,

				 				And many things that were unjust I did;

				 				For in my strength and in my father’s power,

				 				And valor of my brothers, I had put

				 				My trust. Let no man, therefore, dare to be

				 				Unjust in aught, but tranquilly enjoy

				 				Whatever good the gods vouchsafe to give.

				 				Yet are these suitors guilty of foul wrong,

				 				Wasting the substance and dishonoring

				 				The wife of one who will not, as I deem,

				 				Remain long distant from his friends and home,

				 				But is already near. O, may some god

				 				Remove thee from this danger to thy home!

				 				Nor mayst thou meet him when he shall return

				 				To his own land. For when he comes once more

				 				Beneath this roof, and finds the suitors here,

				 				Not without bloodshed will their parting be.”



			 				He spake, and, pouring out a part, he drank

				 				The wine, and gave the goblet to the prince,

				 				Who crossed the hall, and sorrowfully shook

				 				His head, for now already did his heart

				 				Forebode the coming evil. Not by this

				 				Did he escape his death. Minerva laid

				 				A snare for him, that he might fall beneath,

				 				The strong arm of Telemachus. He went

				 				And took the seat from which he lately rose.



			 				Then blue-eyed Pallas moved Penelope,

				 				Sage daughter of Icarius, to appear

				 				Before the suitors, that their base intent

				 				Might be more fully seen, and she might win

				 				More honor from her husband and her son.

				 				Wherefore she forced a laugh, and thus began:﻿—



			 				“Eurynomè, I would at length appear,

				 				Though not till now, before the suitor-train,

				 				Detested as they are. I there would speak

				 				A word of timely warning to my son,

				 				And give him counsel not to trust himself

				 				Too much among the suitors, who are fair

				 				In speech, but mean him foully in their hearts.”



			 				Eurynomè, the household matron, said:

				 				“Assuredly, my child, thou speakest well.

				 				Go now, and warn thy son, and keep back naught.

				 				First bathe, and, ere thou go, anoint thy cheeks,

				 				Nor show them stained with tears. It is not well

				 				To sorrow without end. For now thy son

				 				Is grown, and thou beholdest him at length

				 				What thou didst pray the gods, when he was born,

				 				That he might yet become, a bearded man.”



			 				And then the sage Penelope rejoined:

				 				“Though anxious for my sake, persuade me not,

				 				Eurynomè, to bathe, nor to anoint

				 				My cheeks with oil. The gods inhabiting

				 				Olympus took away their comeliness

				 				When in his roomy ships my husband sailed;

				 				But bid Antinoe come, and call with her

				 				Hippodameïa, that they both may stand

				 				Beside me in the hall. I will not go

				 				Alone among the men, for very shame.”



			 				She spake, the aged dame went forth to bear

				 				The message, and to bring the women back.

				 				While blue-eyed Pallas had yet other cares,

				 				She brought a balmy sleep, and shed it o’er

				 				The daughter of Icarius, as she lay

				 				Reclined upon her couch, her limbs relaxed

				 				In rest. The glorious goddess gave a dower

				 				Of heavenly graces, that the Achaian chiefs

				 				Might look on her amazed. She lighted up

				 				Her fair face with a beauty all divine,

				 				Such as the queenly Cytherea wears

				 				When in the mazes of the dance she joins

				 				The Graces. Then she made her to the sight

				 				Of loftier stature and of statelier size,

				 				And fairer than the ivory newly carved.

				 				This having done, the gracious power withdrew,

				 				While from the palace came the white-armed maids,

				 				And prattled as they came. The balmy sleep

				 				Forsook their mistress at the sound. She passed

				 				Her hands across her cheeks, and thus she spake:﻿—



			 				“ ’Twas a sweet sleep that, in my wretchedness,

				 				Wrapped me just now. Would that, this very hour,

				 				The chaste Diana by so soft a death

				 				Might end me, that my days might be no more

				 				Consumed in sorrow for a husband lost,

				 				Of peerless worth, the noblest of the Greeks.”



			 				She spake, and from the royal bower went down,

				 				Yet not alone; two maidens went with her.

				 				And when that most august of womankind

				 				Drew near the suitors, at the door she stopped

				 				Of that magnificent hall, and o’er her cheeks

				 				Let fall the lustrous veil, while on each side

				 				A modest maiden stood. The suitors all

				 				Felt their knees tremble, and were sick with love,

				 				And all desired her. Then the queen bespake

				 				Telemachus, her well-beloved son:﻿—



			 				“Telemachus, thy judgment is not firm,

				 				Nor dost thou think aright. While yet a boy

				 				Thy thought was wiser. Now that thou art grown,

				 				And on the verge of manhood, so that one

				 				Who comes from far and sees thy noble part

				 				And stature well may say thou art the son

				 				Of a most fortunate father, yet to think

				 				And judge discreetly thou art not as then,

				 				For what a deed is this which has been done

				 				Even here! Thou hast allowed a stranger guest

				 				To be assaulted rudely. How is this?

				 				If one who sits a guest beneath our roof

				 				Be outraged thus, be sure it brings to thee

				 				Great shame and rank dishonor among men.”



			 				To this discreet Telemachus replied:

				 				“Mother, I cannot take it ill that thou

				 				Shouldst be offended. But of many things

				 				I have a clear discernment, and can weigh

				 				The good and bad. I was till now a child,

				 				Yet even now I cannot always see

				 				The wiser course. These men bewilder me,

				 				As, sitting side by side, they lay their plots

				 				Against me, and I have no helper here.

				 				When Irus and the stranger fought, the strife

				 				Had no such issue as the suitors wished.

				 				The stranger conquered. Would to Father Jove,

				 				To Pallas and Apollo, that the crew

				 				Of suitors here might sit with nodding heads

				 				Struck down upon the spot, within these halls

				 				Or in the courts, and all with powerless limbs,

				 				As Irus sits beside the gate and nods,

				 				Like one o’ercome with wine, nor can he stand

				 				Upon his feet, nor go to where he dwells,

				 				If home he has, so feeble are his limbs.”



			 				So talked the twain awhile; then interposed

				 				Eurymachus, and thus bespake the queen:﻿—



			 				“Sage daughter of Icarius! if all those

				 				Who in Iäsian Argos have their homes

				 				Should once behold thee, a still larger crowd

				 				Of suitors would tomorrow come and feast

				 				Within thy halls, so much dost thou excel

				 				In mind and form and face all womankind.”



			 				To this the sage Penelope replied:

				 				“Eurymachus, the immortals took away

				 				Such grace of form and face as once was mine,

				 				What time the sons of Argos sailed for Troy,

				 				And with them went Ulysses, my espoused.

				 				Should he return, and take again in charge

				 				My household, greater would my glory be,

				 				And prized more highly. I am wretched now,

				 				Such woes the gods have heaped upon my head.

				 				He, when he left his native island, grasped

				 				My right hand at the wrist, and said to me:

				 				‘Think not, dear wife, that all the well-armed Greeks

				 				Will come back safe from Troy. The Trojan men,

				 				They say, are brave in war, expert to cast

				 				The spear and wing the arrow, skilled to rein

				 				The rapid steeds by which the bloody strife

				 				Of battlefields is hurried to its close;

				 				And therefore whether God will bring me back,

				 				Or I shall fall in Troy, I cannot know.

				 				Take charge of all things here. I leave with thee

				 				My father and my mother in these halls.

				 				Be kind to them as now, nay, more than now,

				 				Since I shall not be here. When thou shalt see

				 				My son a bearded man, take to thyself

				 				A husband, whom thou wilt, and leave thy house.’

				 				Such were his words, and they have been fulfilled.

				 				The night will come in which I must endure

				 				This hateful marriage, wretched that I am,

				 				To whom the will of Jupiter forbids

				 				All consolation, and this bitter thought

				 				Weighs evermore upon my heart and soul.

				 				The custom was not thus in other times;

				 				When suitors wooed a noble wife, the child

				 				Of some rich house, contending for her smile,

				 				They came with beeves and fatling sheep to feast

				 				The damsel’s friends, and gave munificent gifts,

				 				But wasted not the wealth that was not theirs.”



			 				She spake, Ulysses was rejoiced to see

				 				That thus she sought to draw from each a gift,

				 				With fair and artful words. Yet were his thoughts

				 				Intent on other plans. Eupeithes’ son,

				 				Antinoüs, thus made answer to the queen:﻿—



			 				“Sage daughter of Icarius, only deign

				 				To take the gifts which any of the Greeks

				 				Will bring﻿—nor is it gracious to reject

				 				A present﻿—yet be sure we go not hence,

				 				To our estates nor elsewhere, till thou make

				 				A bridegroom of the best Achaian here.”



			 				So spake Antinoüs. All approved his words,

				 				And each sent forth a herald for his gift.

				 				The herald of Antinoüs brought to him

				 				A robe of many colors, beautiful

				 				And ample, with twelve golden clasps, which each

				 				Had its well-fitted eye. Eurymachus

				 				Received a golden necklace, richly wrought,

				 				And set with amber beads, that glowed as if

				 				With sunshine. To Eurydamas there came

				 				A pair of earrings, each a triple gem,

				 				Daintily fashioned and of exquisite grace.

				 				Two servants bore them. From Pisander’s house﻿—

				 				Son of the Prince Polyctor﻿—there was brought

				 				A collar of rare beauty. Thus did each

				 				Bestow a different yet becoming gift.

				 				And then that most august of women went

				 				Back to the upper chambers with her maids,

				 				Who bore the sumptuous presents, while below

				 				The suitors turned them to the dance and song,

				 				Amused till evening came. Its darkness stole

				 				Over their pastime. Then they brought and placed

				 				Three hearths to light the palace, heaping them

				 				With wood, well dried and hard and newly cleft.

				 				With this they mingled flaming brands. The maids

				 				Of the great sufferer, Ulysses, fed

				 				The fire by turns. To them the hero spake:﻿—



			 				“Ye maidens of a sovereign absent long,

				 				Withdraw to where your highborn mistress sits;

				 				There turn the spindle, seeking to amuse

				 				Her lonely hours; there comb with your own hands

				 				The fleece, and I will see that these have light.

				 				Even though they linger till the Morn is here

				 				In her bright car, they cannot overcome

				 				My patience. I am practised to endure.”



			 				So spake he, and the maidens, as they heard,

				 				Cast at each other meaning looks, and laughed,

				 				And one Melantho, of the rosy cheeks,

				 				Railed at him impudently. She was born

				 				To Dolius, but Penelope had reared

				 				The damsel as a daughter of her own,

				 				And given her, for her pleasure, many things;

				 				Yet for the sorrows of Penelope

				 				Melantho little cared. Eurymachus

				 				Had made the girl his paramour. She spake,

				 				And chid Ulysses with unmannerly words:﻿—



			 				“Outlandish wretch! thou must be one whose brain

				 				Is turned, since thou wilt neither go to sleep

				 				Within a smithy, nor in any place

				 				Of public shelter, but wilt stay and prate

				 				Among this company with no restraint

				 				Or reverence. Either wine has stolen away

				 				Thy senses, or thy natural mood, perchance,

				 				Prompts thee to chatter idly. Art thou proud

				 				Of conquering Irus, that poor vagabond?

				 				Beware lest someone of robuster arms

				 				Than Irus seize and thrust thee out of doors

				 				With a bruised head and face begrimed with blood.”



			 				The sage Ulysses frowned on her and said:

				 				“Impudent one, Telemachus shall hear

				 				From me the saucy words which thou hast said,

				 				And he will come and hew thee limb from limb.”



			 				He spake; the damsels, frightened at his words,

				 				Fled through the hall, and shook in every limb

				 				With terror, lest his threat should be fulfilled.

				 				He meantime stood beside the kindled hearths

				 				And fed the flames, and, looking on the crowd

				 				Of suitors, brooded in his secret heart

				 				O’er plans that would not fail to be fulfilled.



			 				But Pallas suffered not the suitors yet

				 				To cease from railing speeches, all the more

				 				To wound the spirit of Laertes’ son.

				 				Eurymachus, the son of Polybus,

				 				Began to scoff at him, and thus he spake

				 				To wake the ready laughter of the rest:﻿—



			 				“Hear me, ye suitors of the illustrious queen.

				 				I speak the thought that comes into my mind.

				 				Led by some god, no doubt, this man has come

				 				Into the palace; for the light we have

				 				Of torches seems to issue from the crown

				 				Of his bald pate, a head without a hair.”



			 				So said Eurymachus, and then bespake

				 				Ulysses, the destroyer of walled towns:﻿—



			 				“Stranger, if I accept thee, wilt thou serve

				 				Upon the distant parts of my estate?

				 				There shalt thou have fair wages, and shalt bring

				 				The stones in heaps together, and shalt plant

				 				Tall trees, and I will feed thee through the year,

				 				And give thee clothes, and sandals for thy feet.

				 				But thou art used, no doubt, to idle ways,

				 				And never dost thou work with willing hands,

				 				Bat dost prefer to roam the town and beg,

				 				Purveying for thy gluttonous appetite.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:﻿—

				 				“Eurymachus, if we were matched in work

				 				Against each other in the time of spring

				 				When days are long, and both were mowing grass,

				 				And I had a curved scythe in hand and thou

				 				Another, that we might keep up the strife

				 				Till nightfall, fasting, mid the abundant grass;

				 				Or if there were a yoke of steers to drive,

				 				The sturdiest of their kind, sleek, large, well fed,

				 				Of equal age, and equal strength to bear

				 				The labor, and both strong, and if the field

				 				Were of four acres, with a soil through which

				 				The plough could cleave its way﻿—then shouldst thou see

				 				How evenly my furrow would be turned.

				 				Or should the son of Saturn send today

				 				War from abroad, and I had but a shield,

				 				Two spears, and, fitted to my brows, a helm

				 				Of brass, thou wouldst behold me pressing on

				 				Among the foremost warriors, and would see

				 				No cause to rail at my keen appetite.

				 				But arrogantly thou dost bear thyself,

				 				And pitilessly; thou in thine own eyes

				 				Art great and mighty, since thou dost consort

				 				With few, and those are not the best of men.

				 				Yet should Ulysses come to his own land,

				 				These gates that seem so wide would suddenly

				 				Become too narrow for thee in thy flight.”



			 				He spake. Eurymachus grew yet more wroth,

				 				And frowned on him, and said in winged words:﻿—



			 				“Wretch! I shall do thee mischief. Thou art bold,

				 				And babblest unabashed among us all.

				 				The wine, perhaps, is in thy foolish head,

				 				Or thou art always thus, and ever prone

				 				To prattle impudently. Art thou proud

				 				Of conquering Irus, that poor vagabond?”



			 				Thus having said, he brandished in the air

				 				A footstool; but Ulysses, to escape

				 				The anger of Eurymachus, sat down

				 				Before the knees of the Dulichian prince,

				 				Amphinomus. The footstool flew, and struck

				 				On the right arm the cupbearer. Down fell

				 				The beaker ringing; he who bore it lay

				 				Stretched in the dust. Then in those shadowy halls

				 				The suitors rose in tumult. One of them

				 				Looked at another by his side, and said:﻿—



			 				“Would that this vagabond had met his death

				 				Ere he came hither. This confusion, then,

				 				Had never been. ’Tis for a beggar’s sake

				 				We wrangle, and the feast will henceforth give

				 				No pleasure; we shall go from bad to worse.”



			 				Then rose in majesty Telemachus,

				 				And said: “Ye are not in your senses sure,

				 				Unhappy men, who cannot eat and drink

				 				In peace. Some deity, no doubt, has moved

				 				Your minds to frenzy. Now, when each of you

				 				Has feasted well, let each withdraw to sleep,

				 				Just when he will. I drive no man away.”



			 				He spake; the suitors heard, and bit their lips,

				 				And wondered at Telemachus, who spake

				 				So resolutely. Then Amphinomus,

				 				The son of Nisus Aretiades,

				 				Stood forth, harangued the suitor-crowd, and said:﻿—



			 				“O friends! let no one here with carping words

				 				Seek to deny what is so justly said,

				 				Nor yet molest the stranger, nor do harm

				 				To any of the servants in the halls

				 				Of the great chief Ulysses. Now let him

				 				Who brings the guests their wine begin and fill

				 				The cups, that, pouring to the gods their part,

				 				We may withdraw to sleep. The stranger here

				 				Leave me within the palace, and in charge

				 				Of him to whom he came, Telemachus.”



			 				He ended. All were pleased, and Mutlus then,

				 				Hero and herald from Dulichium’s coast,

				 				And follower of the prince Amphinomus,

				 				Mingled a jar of wine, and went to each,

				 				Dispensing it. They to the blessed gods

				 				Poured first a part, and then they drank themselves

				 				The generous juice. And when the wine was poured,

				 				And they had drunk what each desired, they went

				 				Homeward to slumber, each in his abode.





						Book 						XIX


					Ulysses Recognized by Eurycleia


				 				Remoyal of the weapons from the hall by Ulysses and his son﻿—Interview of Penelope and Ulysses, who tells her that he has seen her husband in Crete, describes his person and dress, and affirms that within a month he will be in Ithaca﻿—The bath administered to Ulysses by Eurycleia, who recognizes him by a scar on his leg﻿—Narrative of the manner in which the scar was caused.





				Now was the godlike chief Ulysses left

				 				In his own palace, planning, with the aid

				 				Of Pallas, to destroy the suitor-train,

				 				And thus bespake his son with winged words:﻿—



			 				“Now is the time, Telemachus, to take

				 				The weapons thac are here, and store them up

				 				In the inner rooms. Then, if the suitors ask

				 				The reason, answer them with specious words:

				 				Say, ‘I have put them where there comes no smoke.

				 				Since even now they do not seem the arms

				 				Left by Ulysses when he sailed for Troy,

				 				So tarnished are they by the breath of fire;

				 				And yet another reason sways my mind,

				 				The prompting of some god, that ye, when flushed

				 				With wine and in the heat of a dispute,

				 				May smite and wound each other, and disgrace

				 				The banquet and your wooing; for the sight

				 				Of steel doth draw men on to violence.’ ”



			 				He ended, and Telemachus obeyed

				 				His father’s words, and calling forth his nurse,

				 				The aged Eurycleia, said to her:﻿—



			 				“Go, nurse, and see the women all shut up

				 				In their own place, while in our inner room

				 				I lay away my father’s beautiful arms,

				 				Neglected long, and sullied by the smoke,

				 				While he was absent. I was then a child,

				 				But now would keep them from the breath of fire.”



			 				And thus the nurse, Dame Eurycleia, said:

				 				“Would that at length, my child, thou didst exert

				 				Thy proper wisdom here, and take in charge

				 				Thy house and thy possessions. But who goes

				 				With thee to bear a torch, since none of these,

				 				Thy handmaids, are allowed to light thy way?”



			 				And thus discreet Telemachus replied:

				 				“This stranger. No man may be idle here

				 				Who eats my bread, though from a distant land.”



			 				He spake, nor flew his words in vain. The nurse

				 				Closed all the portals of that noble pile.

				 				Ulysses and his glorious son in haste

				 				Bore off the helmets, and the bossy shields,

				 				And the sharp spears, while Pallas held to them

				 				A golden lamp, that shed a fair clear light.

				 				Then to his father spake Telemachus:﻿—



			 				“Father! my eyes behold a marvel. All

				 				The palace walls, each beautiful recess,

				 				The fir-tree beams, the aspiring columns, shine,

				 				Before my eyes, as with a blaze of fire.

				 				Some god is surely here, someone of those

				 				Who make their dwelling in the high broad heaven.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:

				 				“Keep silence; give thy thought no speech, nor ask

				 				Concerning aught. Such is the wont of those

				 				Who dwell upon Olympus. Now withdraw

				 				To rest upon thy couch, while I remain,

				 				For I would move thy mother and her maids

				 				To ask of what concerns me. She, I deem,

				 				Full sadly will inquire of many things.”



			 				He spake; Telemachus departed thence,

				 				By torchlight, to his chamber, there to rest

				 				Where he was wont to lie when gentle sleep

				 				Came over him. There lay he down to wait

				 				The hallowed morning, while Ulysses, left

				 				Within the palace, meditated still

				 				Death to the suitors with Minerva’s aid.



			 				The sage Penelope now left her bower;

				 				Like Dian or like golden Venus came

				 				The queen. Beside the hearth they placed for her

				 				The throne where she was wont to sit, inlaid

				 				With ivory and silver, which of yore

				 				The artisan Icmalius wrought. They laid

				 				Close to the throne a footstool, over which

				 				Was spread an ample fleece. On this sat down

				 				The sage Penelope. Her white-armed train

				 				Of handmaids came with her; they cleared away

				 				The abundant feast, and bore the tables off,

				 				And cups from which those insolent men had drunk;

				 				They laid upon the ground the lighted brands,

				 				And heaped fresh fuel round them, both for light

				 				And warmth. And now Melantho once again

				 				Bespake Ulysses with unmannerly words:﻿—



			 				“Stranger, wilt thou forever be a pest,

				 				Ranging the house at night to play the spy

				 				Upon the women? Leave the hall, thou wretch!

				 				And gorge thyself without, else wilt thou go

				 				Suddenly, driven by blows and flaming brands.”



			 				The sage Ulysses frowned on her, and said:

				 				“Pert creature! why so fiercely rail at me?

				 				Is it that I am squalid and ill-clad,

				 				And forced by want to beg from hand to hand?

				 				Such is the fate of poor and wandering men.

				 				I too was opulent once, inhabiting

				 				A plenteous home among my fellow-men,

				 				And often gave the wanderer alms, whoe’er

				 				He might be and in whatsoever need;

				 				And I had many servants, and large store

				 				Of things by which men lead a life of ease

				 				And are called rich. But Jupiter, the son

				 				Of Saturn, put an end to this, for so

				 				It pleased the god. Now, therefore, woman, think

				 				That thou mayst lose the beauty which is now

				 				Thy pride among the serving-women here;

				 				Thy mistress may be wroth, and make thy life

				 				A hard one; or Ulysses may come back﻿—

				 				And there is hope of that. Or if it be

				 				That he has perished, and returns no more,

				 				There still remains his son Telemachus,

				 				Who by Apollo’s grace is now a man,

				 				And no one of the women in these halls

				 				May think to misbehave, and yet escape

				 				His eye, for he no longer is a boy.”



			 				He spake; Penelope, the prudent, heard,

				 				And, calling to her maid, rebuked her thus:﻿—



			 				“O bold and shameless! I have taken note

				 				Of thy behavior; thou hast done a wrong

				 				For which thy head should answer. Well thou know’st,

				 				For thou hast heard me say, that I would ask

				 				The stranger in these halls if aught he knows

				 				Of my Ulysses, for whose sake I grieve.”



			 				Then to the matron of the household turned

				 				The queen, and thus bespake Eurynomè:﻿—



			 				“Bring now a seat, Eurynomè, and spread

				 				A fleece upon it, where the stranger guest

				 				May sit at ease, and hear what I shall say,

				 				And answer me, for I have much to ask.”



			 				She spake; the ancient handmaid brought with speed

				 				A polished seat, and o’er it spread a fleece.

				 				Ulysses, much-enduring chief, sat down,

				 				And thus the sage Penelope began:﻿—



			 				“First will I ask thee who thou art, and whence,

				 				Where is thy birthplace, and thy parents who?”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:

				 				“O lady, none in all the boundless earth

				 				Can speak of thee with blame. Thy fame has reached

				 				To the great heavens. It is like the renown

				 				Of some most excellent king, of godlike sway

				 				O’er many men and mighty, who upholds

				 				Justice in all his realm. The dark-soiled earth

				 				Brings wheat and barley forth; the trees are bowed

				 				With fruit; the meadows swarm with noble herds,

				 				The sea with fish, and under his wise reign

				 				The people prosper. Therefore ask, I pray,

				 				Of other things, while I am underneath

				 				Thy palace-roof, but of my race and home

				 				Inquire not, lest thou waken in my mind

				 				Unhappy memories. I am a man

				 				Of sorrow, and it would become me ill

				 				To sit lamenting in another’s house

				 				And shedding tears. Besides, a grief indulged

				 				Doth grow in violence. Thy maids would blame,

				 				And thou perhaps, and ye would call my tears

				 				The maudlin tears of one o’ercome with wine.”



			 				Then spake the sage Penelope again:

				 				“Stranger, such grace of feature and of form

				 				As once I had the immortals took away,

				 				What time the Argive warriors sailed for Troy,

				 				And my Ulysses with them. Could he now

				 				Return to rule my household as of yore,

				 				The wider and the brighter were my fame.

				 				But now I lead a wretched life, so great

				 				And many are the evils which some god

				 				Heaps on me. For the chieftains who bear sway

				 				Over the isles﻿—Dulichium, and the fields

				 				Of Samos, and Zacynthus dark with woods,

				 				And those who rule in sunny Ithaca﻿—

				 				Woo me against my will, and waste away

				 				My substance. Therefore have I small regard

				 				For strangers and for suppliants, and the tribe

				 				Of heralds, servants of the public weal,

				 				But, pining for Ulysses, wear away

				 				My life. The suitors urge the marriage rite,

				 				And I with art delay it. Once some god

				 				Prompted me to begin an ample web,

				 				Wide and of subtle texture, in my rooms.

				 				And then I said: ‘Youths, who are pressing me

				 				To marriage, since Ulysses is no more,

				 				Urge me no further till I shall complete﻿—

				 				That so the threads may not be spun in vain﻿—

				 				This shroud for old Laertes, when grim fate

				 				And death’s long sleep at last shall overtake

				 				The hero; else among the multitude

				 				Of Grecian women I shall bear the blame,

				 				If one whose ample wealth so well was known

				 				Should lie in death without a funeral robe.’

				 				I spake, and easily their minds were swayed

				 				By what I said, and I began to weave

				 				The ample web, but ravelled it again

				 				By torchlight every evening. For three years

				 				I foiled them thus; but when the fourth year came,

				 				And brought its train of hours and changing moons,

				 				And many days had passed, they came on me,

				 				And through my maidens’ fault, a careless crew,

				 				They caught me at my fraud, and chid me sore.

				 				sSo, though unwilling, I was forced to end

				 				My task, and cannot longer now escape

				 				The marriage, nor is any refuge left.

				 				My parents both exhort me earnestly

				 				To choose a husband, and my son with grief

				 				Beholds the suitors wasting his estate,

				 				And he already is a man and well

				 				Can rule his household; Jupiter bestows so.

				 				Such honor on him. Now, I pray, declare

				 				Thy lineage, for thou surely art not sprung

				 				From the old fabulous oak, nor from a rock.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered her:

				 				“O royal consort of Laertes’ son!

				 				Wilt thou still ask my lineage? I will then

				 				Disclose it, but thou wakest in my heart

				 				New sorrows. So it ever is with one

				 				Who long, like me, is far away from home,

				 				Wandering in many realms, and suffering much;

				 				But since thou dost require it, thou shalt hear.



			 				“Crete is a region lying in the midst

				 				Of the black deep, a fair and fruitful land,

				 				Girt by the waters. Many are the men,

				 				Nay, numberless, who make it their abode,

				 				And ninety are its cities. Different tongues

				 				Are spoken by the dwellers of the isle.

				 				In part they are Achaians, and in part

				 				Are Cretans of the soil, a gallant stock;

				 				There dwell Cydonians, Dorians of three tribes,

				 				And proud Pelasgians. Their great capital

				 				Is Cnossus, where the monarch Minos dwelt,

				 				He who at every nine years’ end conferred

				 				With Jove almighty; and to him was born

				 				Deucalion, my brave father, who begat

				 				Me and Idomeneus, the King of Crete.

				 				To Ilium in his beaked galleys sailed

				 				Idomeneus with Atreus’ sons. My name﻿—

				 				A name well known﻿—is Aethon. ’Twas at Crete

				 				I saw Ulysses, who received from me

				 				The welcome due a guest. A violent wind

				 				Had driven him from Maleia and the course

				 				That led to Ilium, and had carried him

				 				To Crete, and lodged him in the dangerous port

				 				Amnisus, close to Ilithyia’s cave,

				 				Where scarce his fleet escaped the hurricane.

				 				Thence came he to the city, and inquired

				 				For King Idomeneus, who was, he said,

				 				His dear and honored guest; but he had sailed

				 				Ten days before, perhaps eleven, for Troy,

				 				In his beaked galleys. To the palace there

				 				I led Ulysses, and with liberal cheer

				 				Welcomed the chief, for plentifully stored

				 				The royal dwelling was. I also gave

				 				Meal from the public magazines to him

				 				And those who followed him, and dark red wine

				 				Brought from the country round, and beeves to slay

				 				In sacrifice, that so their hearts might feel

				 				No lack of aught. Twelve days the noble Greeks

				 				Remained with us. A violent north-wind,

				 				Which scarcely suffered them to stand upright

				 				On shore, withstood them. Some unfriendly power

				 				Had bid it blow; but on the thirteenth day

				 				Its fury ceased, and the fleet put to sea.”



			 				Thus went he on, inventing tales that seemed

				 				Like truth. She listened, melting into tears

				 				That flowed as when on mountain height the snow,

				 				Shed by the west-wind, feels the east-wind’s breath,

				 				And flows in water, and the hurrying streams

				 				Are filled; so did Penelope’s fair cheeks

				 				Seem to dissolve in tears﻿—tears shed for him

				 				Who sat beside her even then. He saw

				 				His weeping wife, and pitied her at heart;

				 				Yet were his eyes like iron or like horn,

				 				And moved not in their lids; for artfully

				 				He kept his tears from falling. When the queen

				 				Had ceased to weep, she answered him and said:﻿—



			 				“Now, stranger, let me prove thee, if in truth

				 				Thou didst receive, as thou hast just declared,

				 				In thine abode, my husband and his train

				 				Of noble friends. Describe the garb he wore;

				 				How looked he, and the friends he brought with him?”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered her:

				 				“O lady, hard it is to answer thee,

				 				So long have I been far away from home.

				 				’Tis now the twentieth year since he was there

				 				And left the isle, but, as my memory bids,

				 				So will I speak. A fleecy purple cloak

				 				Ulysses wore, a double web; the clasp

				 				Was golden, with two fastenings, and in front

				 				It showed a work of rare design﻿—a hound

				 				That held in his forepaws a spotted fawn,

				 				Struggling before his open mouth. Although

				 				The figures were of gold, we all admired

				 				The hound intent to break his victim’s neck,

				 				The fawn that, writhing, plied her nimble feet

				 				To free herself. Around the hero’s chest

				 				And waist I saw a lustrous tunic worn,

				 				Soft, like the thin film of the onion dried,

				 				And bright as sunshine; many ladies looked

				 				With wonder on it. Yet consider this;

				 				I know not whether thus attired he left

				 				His home, or whether, in the voyage thence,

				 				Some comrade gave the garments, or perhaps

				 				Some friendly host, for he was very dear

				 				To many; among the Greeks were few like him.

				 				I gave him, from myself, a brazen sword,

				 				And a fair purple cloak, a double web,

				 				Besides a tunic reaching to his feet,

				 				And with due honors sent him on his way

				 				In his good ship. There came and went with him

				 				A herald somewhat older than himself;

				 				Let me portray him﻿—hunchbacked, swarthy skinned,

				 				And curly haired, Eurybates his name.

				 				Ulysses honored him above the rest

				 				Of his companions, for they thought alike.”



			 				He ceased; the queen was moved to deeper grief,

				 				For she remembered all the tokens well

				 				Of which he spake; and when that passionate gust

				 				Of weeping ceased, she spake again and said:﻿—



			 				“Stranger, till now thy presence in these halls

				 				Has only moved my pity; thou henceforth

				 				Art dear and honored. It was I who gave

				 				The garments thou hast told me of; these hands

				 				Folded them in my chamber. I put on

				 				The glittering clasp to be his ornament,

				 				And now I never shall behold him more

				 				Returning to his own dear land and home;

				 				So cruel was the fate that took him hence

				 				To Ilium, in his roomy ship, a town

				 				Of evil omen never to be named.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:

				 				“O gracious consort of Laertes’ son!

				 				Let not thy grief for him whom thou hast lost

				 				Wither thy beauty longer, and consume

				 				Thy heart. And yet I blame thee not at all;

				 				For any wife in losing him to whom

				 				She gave herself while yet a maid, and bore

				 				Children, will mourn him, though he be in worth

				 				Below Ulysses, who, as fame declares,

				 				Is like the gods. But cease to grieve, and hear

				 				What I shall say, and I shall speak the truth,

				 				Nor will I hide from thee that I have heard,

				 				But lately from Ulysses, yet alive,

				 				And journeying homeward, in the opulent realm

				 				Of the Thesprotians, whence he brings with him

				 				Much and rare treasure, gathered there among

				 				The people. His beloved friends he lost,

				 				And his good ship; the black deep swallowed them

				 				In coming from Trinacria, for his crew

				 				Had slaughtered there the oxen of the Sun.

				 				The Sun and Jove were angry; therefore all

				 				His comrades perished in the billowy sea;

				 				But him upon his galley’s keel the wind

				 				Drove to the coast where the Phaeacians dwell,

				 				The kinsmen of the gods. They welcomed him,

				 				And honored him as if he were a god,

				 				And gave him many things, and would have sent

				 				The hero safely to his native isle;

				 				And here Ulysses would have been long since,

				 				But that he deemed it wise to travel far,

				 				And gather wealth﻿—for well Ulysses knew,

				 				Beyond all other men, the arts of gain,

				 				And none in these could think to rival him;

				 				So Pheidon, king of the Thesprotians said,

				 				Who also, in his palace, swore to me﻿—

				 				As to the gods of heaven he poured the wine﻿—

				 				That even then a galley was drawn down

				 				Into the water, and already manned

				 				With rowers, who should take Ulysses home.

				 				But me he first dismissed, for at the time

				 				A barque of the Thesprotians left the port,

				 				Bound for Dulichium’s cornfields. Ere I went

				 				He showed the treasures of Ulysses stored

				 				In the king’s palace﻿—treasures that might serve

				 				To feed the household of another chief

				 				To the tenth generation. He who owned

				 				That wealth was at Dodona, so the king

				 				Declared, inquiring, at the lofty oak

				 				Of Jupiter, the counsel of the god

				 				How to return to his dear native land,

				 				So long a wanderer﻿—whether openly

				 				Or else by stealth. So he is safe, and soon

				 				Will he be nearer to us; for not long

				 				Can he remain away from all his friends

				 				And fatherland. To this I plight my oath;

				 				Let Jove, the greatest and the best of gods,

				 				Be witness, and this hearth of the good prince

				 				Ulysses, where I sit, that every word

				 				Which I have said to thee will be fulfilled.

				 				Within the year Ulysses will return,

				 				As this month passes and the next comes in.”



			 				Then spake the sage Penelope again:

				 				“Would that it might be thus, O stranger guest,

				 				As thou hast said; then shouldst thou have such thanks

				 				And bounty at my hands that everyone

				 				Who meets thee should rejoice with thee. And yet

				 				The thought abides with me, and so indeed

				 				It must be, that Ulysses will no more

				 				Return, nor wilt thou find an escort hence;

				 				For now no master like Ulysses rules﻿—

				 				And what a man was he!﻿—within these walls,

				 				To welcome or dismiss the honored guest.

				 				But now, ye maidens, let the stranger bathe,

				 				And spread his couch with blankets, fleecy cloaks,

				 				And showy tapestries, that he may lie

				 				Warm till the Morning, in her golden car,

				 				Draw near; then with the early morn again

				 				Bathe and anoint him, that he may sit down

				 				Beside Telemachus prepared to take

				 				His morning meal. Ill shall he fare who dares

				 				Molest the stranger; he shall have no place

				 				Or office here, however he may rage.

				 				And how, O stranger, wouldst thou learn that I

				 				In mind and thoughtful wisdom am above

				 				All other women, if I let thee sit

				 				Squalid and meanly clad at banquets here?

				 				Short is the life of man, and whoso bears

				 				A cruel heart, devising cruel things,

				 				On him men call down evil from the gods

				 				While living, and pursue him, when he dies,

				 				With scoffs. But whoso is of generous heart

				 				And harbors generous aims, his guests proclaim

				 				His praises far and wide to all mankind,

				 				And numberless are they who call him good.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:

				 				“O gracious consort of Laertes’ son!

				 				Such cloaks and splendid coverings please me not,

				 				Since in my long-oared barque I left behind

				 				The snowy peaks of Crete. I still will lie,

				 				As I am wont through many a sleepless night,

				 				On a mean couch to wait the holy Morn

				 				Upon her car of gold. I do not like

				 				This washing of the feet. No maiden here

				 				That ministers to thee may touch my foot;

				 				But if among them be some aged dame

				 				And faithful, who has suffered in her life

				 				As I have suffered, she may touch my feet.”



			 				And thus the sage Penelope rejoined:

				 				“Dear guest﻿—for never to these halls has come

				 				A stranger so discreet or better liked

				 				By me, so wisely thou dost speak, and well﻿—

				 				I have an aged prudent dame, whose care

				 				Reared my unfortunate husband. She received

				 				The nursling when his mother brought him forth,

				 				And she, though small her strength, will wash thy feet.

				 				Rise, prudent Eurycleia, thou shalt wash

				 				The feet of one whose years must be the same

				 				As thy own master’s; such is doubtless now

				 				Ulysses, with such wrinkled feet and hands.

				 				For quickly doth misfortune make men old.”



			 				She spake; the aged handmaid hid her face

				 				With both her hands, and, shedding bitter tears,

				 				Thus sorrowfully to the queen replied:﻿—



			 				“My heart is sad for thee, my son; and yet

				 				I can do nothing. Can it be that Jove

				 				Hates thee beyond all other? though thyself

				 				So reverent to the gods? No man on earth

				 				Has burned so many thighs of fatling beasts

				 				And chosen hecatombs as thou to Jove

				 				The Thunderer, with prayer that thou mayst reach

				 				A calm old age, and rear thy glorious son

				 				To manhood; yet the god hath cut thee off

				 				From thy return forever. Even now

				 				Perchance the women of some princely house

				 				Which he has entered in some distant land

				 				Scoff at him as these wretched creatures scoff

				 				At thee, O stranger, who, to shun their taunts

				 				And insults, wilt not suffer them to wash

				 				Thy feet. The sage Penelope commands,

				 				And I am not unwilling. I will wash

				 				Thy feet, both for her sake and for thy own;

				 				For deeply am I moved at sight of thee.

				 				Hear what I say: of strangers in distress

				 				Come many hither, yet have I beheld

				 				No one who bears, in shape and voice and feet,

				 				Such likeness to our absent lord as thou.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, thus replied:

				 				“O aged woman, so has it been said

				 				By all who have beheld both him and me.

				 				They all declare that we are very like

				 				Each other; thou in this hast spoken well.”



			 				He spake; she took a shining vase designed

				 				For washing feet, and poured cold water in

				 				In large abundance, and warm water next.

				 				Ulysses, who had sat before the hearth,

				 				Moved to a darker spot, for in his mind

				 				The thought arose that she might find a scar

				 				Upon his limbs in handling them, and thus

				 				His secret would be known. She came and bathed

				 				His feet, and found the scar. ’Twas where a boar

				 				With his white tooth had gashed the limb, as once

				 				He journeyed to Parnassus, where he paid

				 				A visit to Autolycus and his sons,

				 				His mother’s noble father, who excelled

				 				All men in craft and oaths, such was the gift

				 				Conferred on him by Hermes; for to him

				 				Autolycus made grateful offerings,

				 				The thighs of lambs and kids, and evermore

				 				The god was with him. Once Autolycus

				 				Came to the opulent realm of Ithaca,

				 				And found his daughter with a son new born;

				 				There Eurycleia placed upon his knees

				 				The infant, just as he had supped, and said:﻿—



			 				“Give this dear babe, Autolycus, a name﻿—

				 				Thy daughter’s son, vouchsafed to many prayers.”



			 				And thus Autolycus in answer spake:

				 				“Daughter and son-in-law, be his the name

				 				That I shall give. In coming to his isle

				 				I bear the hate of many﻿—both of men

				 				And women﻿—scattered o’er the nourishing earth;

				 				Name him Ulysses therefore, and when, grown

				 				To man’s estate, he visits the proud halls

				 				Reared at Parnassus, where his mother dwelt

				 				And my possessions lie, I will bestow

				 				A share on him, and send him home rejoiced.”



			 				And therefore went Ulysses to receive

				 				The promised princely gifts. Autolycus

				 				And all his sons received him with kind words,

				 				And friendly grasp of hands. Amphithea there﻿—

				 				His mother’s mother﻿—took him in her arms,

				 				And kissed his brow and both his beautiful eyes.

				 				Then to his noble sons Autolycus

				 				Called to prepare a feast, and they obeyed.

				 				They brought and slew a steer of five years old,

				 				And flayed and dressed it, hewed the joints apart,

				 				And sliced the flesh, and fixed it upon spits,

				 				Roasted it carefully, and gave to each

				 				His part. So all the day till set of sun

				 				They feasted, to the full content of all.

				 				And when the sun had set, and earth grew dark,

				 				They laid them down, and took the gift of sleep.

				 				But when the rosy-fingered Morn appeared,

				 				Born of the Dawn, forth issued the young men,

				 				The children of Autolycus, with hounds,

				 				To hunt, attended by their noble guest,

				 				Ulysses. Up the steeps of that high mount

				 				Parnassus, clothed with woods, they climbed, and soon

				 				Were on its airy heights. The sun, new risen

				 				From the deep ocean’s gently flowing stream,

				 				Now smote the fields. The hunters reached a dell;

				 				The hounds before them tracked the game; behind

				 				Followed the children of Autolycus.

				 				The generous youth Ulysses, brandishing

				 				A spear of mighty length, came pressing on

				 				Close to the hounds. There lay a huge wild boar

				 				Within a thicket, where moist-blowing winds

				 				Came not, nor in his brightness could the sun

				 				Pierce with his beams the covert, nor the rain

				 				Pelt through, so closely grew the shrubs. The ground

				 				Was heaped with sheddings of the withered leaves.

				 				Around him came the noise of dogs and men

				 				Approaching swiftly. From his lair he sprang

				 				And faced them, with the bristles on his neck

				 				Upright, and flashing eyes. Ulysses rushed

				 				Before the others, with the ponderous spear

				 				Raised high in his strong hand intent to smite.

				 				The boar was first to strike; he dealt a blow

				 				Sidelong, and gashed his foe above the knee,

				 				And tore the flesh, but left untouched the bone.

				 				Ulysses, striking with his burnished spear

				 				The boar’s right shoulder, drove the weapon through.

				 				He fell with piercing cries amid the dust,

				 				And the life left him. Then around their guest

				 				The kindly children of Autolycus

				 				Came and bound up with care the wound, and stanched

				 				With spells the dark blood of the blameless youth,

				 				And hastened with him to their father’s home.

				 				And when Autolycus and they his sons

				 				Had seen him wholly healed, they loaded him

				 				With presents, and, rejoicing for his sake,

				 				Sent him rejoicing back to Ithaca.

				 				His father and his gracious mother there

				 				Rejoiced in turn, and asked him of the scar,

				 				And how it came, and he related all﻿—

				 				How by the white tusk of a savage boar

				 				The wound was given on the Parnassian heights,

				 				As he was hunting with her father’s sons.



			 				The aged woman, as she took the foot

				 				Into her hands, perceived by touch the scar,

				 				And, letting fall the limb, it struck the vase.

				 				Loud rang the brass, the vase was overturned,

				 				And poured the water forth. At once a rush

				 				Of gladness and of grief came o’er her heart.

				 				Tears filled her eyes, and her clear voice was choked.

				 				She touched Ulysses on the chin, and said:﻿—



			 				“Dear child! thou art Ulysses, of a truth.

				 				I knew thee not till I had touched the scar.”



			 				So speaking, toward Penelope she turned

				 				Her eyes, about to tell her that her lord

				 				Was in the palace; but the queen saw not,

				 				And all that passed was unperceived by her,

				 				For Pallas turned her thoughts another way.

				 				Meantime, Ulysses on the nurse’s throat

				 				Laid his right hand, and with the other drew

				 				The aged woman nearer him, and said:﻿—



			 				“Nurse, wouldst thou ruin me, who drew long since

				 				Milk from thy bosom, and who now return,

				 				After much suffering borne for twenty years,

				 				To mine own land? Now then, since thou hast learned

				 				The truth﻿—by prompting of some god, no doubt﻿—

				 				Keep silence, lest some others in the house

				 				Should learn it also. Else﻿—I tell thee this,

				 				And will perform my word﻿—if God permit

				 				That I o’ercome the arrogant suitor-crew,

				 				Nurse as thou art, I spare not even thee,

				 				When in these halls the other maidens die.”



			 				Then thus the prudent Eurycleia said:

				 				“What words, my son, have passed thy lips? for well

				 				Thou knowest my firm mind; it never yields.

				 				Like solid rock or steel I keep my trust.

				 				This let me tell thee, and, I pray thee, keep

				 				My words in mind. If, by the aid of God,

				 				Thou overcome the arrogant suitor-crew,

				 				Then will I name the handmaids that disgrace

				 				Thy household, and point out the innocent.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, thus rejoined:

				 				“Why name them, nurse? It needs not. I myself

				 				Shall watch them, and shall know them all. Hold thou

				 				Thy peace, and leave the issue with the gods.”



			 				He spake; the aged woman left the place

				 				To bring a second bath, for on the floor

				 				The first was spilled. When she had bathed his feet

				 				And made them smooth with oil, Ulysses drew Close to the hearth his seat again, to take 6x5 The warmth, and with his tatters hid the scar. And thus the sage Penelope began:﻿—



			 				“Stranger, but little longer will I yet

				 				Inquire; the hour of grateful rest is near

				 				For those who, though unhappy, can receive

				 				The balm of slumber. Yet for me some god

				 				Appoints immeasurable grief. All day

				 				In sorrows and in sighs, my solace is

				 				To oversee my maidens at their tasks

				 				Here in the palace; but when evening comes,

				 				And all betake themselves to rest, I lie

				 				Upon my couch, and sorrows thick and sharp

				 				Awake new misery in my heart. As when,

				 				In the fresh spring, the swarthy Nightingale,

				 				Daughter of Pandarus, among thick leaves

				 				Sings sweetly to the woods, and, changing oft

				 				The strain, pours forth her voice of many notes,

				 				Lamenting the beloved Itylus,

				 				Her son by royal Zethos, whom she smote

				 				Unwittingly, and slew; with such quick change

				 				My mind is tossed from thought to thought. I muse

				 				Whether to keep my place beside my son,

				 				And hold what here is mine, my dower, my maids

				 				And high-roofed halls, as one who still reveres

				 				Her husband’s bed, and heeds the public voice,

				 				Or follow one of the Achaian chiefs,

				 				The noblest of the wooers, and the one

				 				Who offers marriage presents without stint.

				 				My son’s green years, while he was yet a boy,

				 				Unripe in mind, allowed me not to wed,

				 				And leave his father’s home; but he is grown,

				 				And on the verge of manhood. He desires

				 				That I should leave the palace, for his wrath

				 				Is great against the men who waste his wealth.

				 				Hear, and interpret now a dream of mine:

				 				Within these courts are twenty geese that eat

				 				Corn from the water, and I look on them

				 				Pleased and amused. From off a mountain came

				 				A hook-beaked eagle, broke their necks, and left

				 				Their bodies strewn about the palace dead,

				 				And soared again into the air of heaven.

				 				I wept and moaned, although it was a dream;

				 				And round me came the fair-haired Grecian maids,

				 				Lamenting wildly that the bird of prey

				 				Had slain my geese. Then came the eagle back,

				 				And took his perch upon the jutting roof,

				 				And thus bespake me in a human voice:﻿—



			 				“ ‘O daughter cf Icarius, the renowned!

				 				Let not thy heart be troubled; this is not

				 				A dream, but a true vision, and will be

				 				Fulfilled. The geese denote the suitor-train,

				 				And I, who was an eagle once, am come,

				 				Thy husband, now to end them utterly.’



			 				“He spake; my slumbers left me, and I looked,

				 				And saw the geese that in the palace still

				 				Were at their trough, and feeding as before.”



			 				And thus Ulysses, the sagacious, said:

				 				“Lady, the dream that visited thy sleep

				 				Cannot be wrested to another sense.

				 				Ulysses has himself revealed to thee

				 				The way of its fulfillment. Death is near

				 				The suitors, and not one escapes his doom.”



			 				Then spake the sage Penelope again:

				 				“Of dreams, O stranger, some are meaningless

				 				And idle, and can never be fulfilled.

				 				Two portals are there for their shadowy shapes,

				 				Of ivory one, and one of horn. The dreams

				 				That come through the carved ivory deceive

				 				With promises that never are made good;

				 				But those which pass the doors of polished horn,

				 				And are beheld of men, are ever true.

				 				And yet I cannot hope that my strange dream

				 				Came through them, though my son and I would both

				 				Rejoice if it were so. This let me say,

				 				And heed me well. Tomorrow brings to us

				 				The hateful morn which takes me from my home,

				 				The palace of Ulysses. I shall now

				 				Propose a contest. In the palace court

				 				Ulysses in a row set up twelve stakes,

				 				Like props that hold a galley up; each stake

				 				Had its own ring; he stood afar, and sent

				 				An arrow through them all. I shall propose

				 				This contest to the suitors. He who bends

				 				The bow with easy mastery, and sends

				 				Through the twelve rings an arrow, I will take

				 				To follow from the palace where I passed

				 				My youthful married life﻿—a beautiful home,

				 				And stored with wealth; a home which I shall long

				 				Remember, even in my nightly dreams.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:

				 				“O gracious consort of Laertes’ son!

				 				Let not this contest be delayed; the man

				 				Of ready wiles, Ulysses, will be here

				 				Ere, tampering with the hero’s polished bow,

				 				The suitors shall prevail to stretch the cord,

				 				And send an arrow through the rings of steel.”



			 				And thus the sage Penelope rejoined:

				 				“Stranger, if, sitting in the palace here,

				 				Thou still wouldst entertain me as thou dost,

				 				Sleep would not fall upon my lids; and yet

				 				Sleepless the race of mortals cannot be,

				 				So have the gods ordained, who measure out

				 				His lot to man upon the nourishing earth.

				 				I to the upper rooms withdraw, to take

				 				My place upon the couch which has become

				 				To me a place of sorrow and of tears

				 				Since my Ulysses went away to Troy,

				 				That fatal town which should be named no more.

				 				And I will lay me down; but thou remain

				 				Within these walls, and make the floor thy bed,

				 				Or let these maidens spread a couch for thee.”



			 				Penelope, thus having spoken, went

				 				Up to her royal bower, but not alone;

				 				Her maids went with her. When they were within

				 				She wept for her dear husband, till at length

				 				The blue-eyed Pallas graciously distilled

				 				Upon her closing lids the balm of sleep.





						Book 						XX


					The Last Banquet of the Suitors


				 				Disorderly conduct of the serving-women﻿—Prayer of Ulysses for a favorable omen﻿—Its fulfillment﻿—Preparations for a feast of the suitors in the palace﻿—The feast﻿—Ulysses insulted by Ctesippus, who is reproved by Telemachus﻿—Strange prodigies observed by Theoclymenus, who leaves the hall.





				The noble chief, Ulysses, in the porch

				 				Lay down to rest. An undressed bullock’s hide

				 				Was under him, and over that the skins

				 				Of sheep, which for the daily sacrifice

				 				The Achaians slew. Eurynomè had spread

				 				A cloak above him. There he lay awake,

				 				And meditated how he yet should smite

				 				The suitors down. Meantime, with cries of mirth

				 				And laughter, came the women forth to seek

				 				The suitors’ arms. Ulysses, inly moved

				 				With anger, pondered whether he should rise

				 				And put them all to death, or give their shame

				 				A respite for another night, the last.

				 				His heart raged in his bosom. As a hound

				 				Growls, walking round her whelps, when she beholds

				 				A stranger, and is eager for the attack,

				 				So growled his heart within him, and so fierce

				 				Was his impatience with that shameless crew.

				 				He smote his breast, and thus he chid his heart:﻿—



			 				“Endure it, heart! thou didst bear worse than this.

				 				When the grim Cyclops of resistless strength

				 				Devoured thy brave companions, thou couldst still

				 				Endure, till thou by stratagem didst leave

				 				The cave in which it seemed that thou must die.”



			 				Thus he rebuked his heart, and, growing calm,

				 				His heart submitted; but the hero tossed

				 				From side to side. As when one turns and turns

				 				The stomach of a bullock filled with fat

				 				And blood before a fiercely blazing fire

				 				And wishes it were done, so did the chief

				 				Shift oft from side to side, while pondering how

				 				To lay a strong hand on the multitude

				 				Of shameless suitors﻿—he but one, and they

				 				So many. Meantime Pallas, sliding down

				 				From heaven, in form a woman, came, and there

				 				Beside his bed stood over him, and spake:﻿—



			 				“Why, most unhappy of the sons of men,

				 				Art thou still sleepless? This is thine abode,

				 				And here thou hast thy consort and a son

				 				Whom any man might covet for his own.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:

				 				“Truly, O goddess, all that thou hast said

				 				Is rightly spoken. This perplexes me﻿—

				 				How to lay hands upon these shameless men,

				 				When I am only one, and they a throng

				 				That fill the palace. Yet another thought,

				 				And mightier still﻿—if, by thy aid and Jove’s,

				 				I slay the suitors, how shall I myself

				 				Be safe thereafter? Think, I pray, of this.”



			 				And thus in turn the blue-eyed Pallas said:

				 				“O faint of spirit! in an humbler friend

				 				Than I am, in a friend of mortal birth

				 				And less farseeing, one might put his trust;

				 				But I am born a goddess, and protect

				 				Thy life in every danger. Let me say,

				 				And plainly say, if fifty armed bands

				 				Of men should gather round us, eager all

				 				To take thy life, thou mightest drive away,

				 				Unharmed by them, their herds and pampered flocks.

				 				But give thyself to sleep. To wake and watch

				 				All night is most unwholesome. Thou shalt find

				 				A happy issue from thy troubles yet.”



			 				She spake, and, shedding slumber on his lids,

				 				Upward the glorious goddess took her way

				 				Back to Olympus, when she saw that sleep

				 				Had seized him, making him forget all care

				 				And slackening every limb. His faithful wife

				 				Was still awake, and sat upright and wept

				 				On her soft couch, and after many tears

				 				The glorious lady prayed to Dian thus:﻿—



			 				“Goddess august! Diana, child of Jove!

				 				I would that thou wouldst send into my heart

				 				A shaft to take my life, or that a storm

				 				Would seize and hurl me through the paths of air,

				 				And cast me into ocean’s restless streams,

				 				As once a storm, descending, swept away

				 				The daughters born to Pandarus. The gods

				 				Had slain their parents, and they dwelt alone

				 				As orphans in their palace, nourished there

				 				By blessed Venus with the curds of milk,

				 				And honey, and sweet wine, while Juno gave

				 				Beauty and wit beyond all womankind,

				 				And chaste Diana dignity of form,

				 				And Pallas every art that graces life.

				 				Then, as the blessed Venus went to ask

				 				For them, of Jove the Thunderer, on the heights

				 				Of his Olympian mount, the crowning gift

				 				Of happy marriage﻿—for to Jove is known

				 				Whatever comes to pass, and what shall be

				 				The fortune, good or ill, of mortal men﻿—

				 				The Harpies came meantime, bore off the maids,

				 				And gave them to the hateful sisterhood

				 				Of Furies as their servants. So may those

				 				Who dwell upon Olympus make an end

				 				Of me, or fair-haired Dian strike me down,

				 				That, with the image of Ulysses still

				 				Before my mind, I may not seek to please

				 				One of less worth. This evil might be borne

				 				By one who weeps all day, and feels at heart

				 				A settled sorrow, yet can sleep at night.

				 				For sleep, when once it weighs the eyelids down,

				 				Makes men unmindful both of good and ill,

				 				And all things else. But me some deity

				 				Visits with fearful dreams. There lay by me,

				 				This very night, one like him, as he was

				 				When with his armed men he sailed for Troy;

				 				And I was glad, for certainly I deemed

				 				It was a real presence, and no dream.”



			 				She spake. Just then, upon her car of gold,

				 				Appeared the Morn. The great Ulysses heard

				 				That voice of lamentation; anxiously

				 				He mused; it seemed to him as if the queen

				 				Stood over him and knew him. Gathering up

				 				In haste the cloak and skins on which he slept,

				 				He laid them in the palace on a seat,

				 				But bore the bull’s hide forth in open air,

				 				And lifted up his hands and prayed to Jove:﻿—



			 				“O Father Jove, and all the gods! if ye

				 				Have led me graciously, o’er land and deep,

				 				Across the earth, and, after suffering much,

				 				To mine own isle, let one of those who watch

				 				Within the palace speak some ominous word,

				 				And grant a sign from thee without these walls.”



			 				So prayed he. All-providing Jupiter

				 				Hearkened, and thundered from the clouds around

				 				The bright Olympian peaks. Ulysses heard

				 				With gladness. From a room within the house,

				 				In which the mills of the king’s household stood,

				 				A woman, laboring at the quern, gave forth

				 				An omen also. There were twelve who toiled

				 				In making flour of barley and of wheat﻿—

				 				The strength of man. The rest were all asleep;

				 				Their tasks were done; one only, of less strength

				 				Than any other there, kept toiling on.

				 				She paused a moment, stopped the whirling stone,

				 				And spake these words﻿—a portent for the king:﻿—



			 				“O Father Jove, the king of gods and men!

				 				Thou hast just thundered from the starry heaven,

				 				And yet there is no cloud. To someone here

				 				It is a portent. O perform for me,

				 				All helpless as I am, this one request!

				 				Let now the suitors in this palace take

				 				Their last and final pleasant feast today﻿—

				 				These men who make my limbs, with constant toil,

				 				In grinding corn for them, to lose their strength,

				 				Once let them banquet here, and then no more.”



			 				She spake; the omen of the woman’s words

				 				And Jove’s loud thunder pleased Ulysses well;

				 				And now he deemed he should avenge himself

				 				Upon the guilty ones. The other maids

				 				Of that fair palace of Ulysses woke

				 				And came together, and upon the hearth

				 				Kindled a steady fire. Telemachus

				 				Rose from his bed in presence like a god,

				 				Put on his garments, hung his trenchant sword

				 				Upon his shoulder, tied to his fair feet

				 				The shapely sandals, took his massive spear

				 				Tipped with sharp brass, and, stopping as he reached

				 				The threshold, spake to Eurycleia thus:﻿—



			 				“Dear nurse, have ye with honor fed and lodged

				 				Dur guest, or have ye suffered him to find

				 				A lodging where he might, without your care?

				 				Discerning as she is, my mother pays

				 				High honor to the worse among her guests,

				 				And sends the nobler man unhonored hence.”



			 				And thus the prudent Eurycleia said:

				 				“My child, blame not thy mother; she deserves

				 				No blame. The stranger sat and drank his wine,

				 				All that he would, and said, when pressed to eat,

				 				That he desired no more. And when he thought

				 				Of sleep, she bade her maidens spread his couch;

				 				But he refused a bed and rugs, like one

				 				Inured to misery, and beneath the porch

				 				Slept on an undressed bull’s hide and the skins

				 				Of sheep, and over him we cast a cloak.”



			 				She spake; Telemachus, his spear in hand,

				 				Went forth, his fleet dogs following him. He sought

				 				The council where the well-greaved Greeks were met.

				 				Meantime the noble Eurycleia, child

				 				Of Ops, Pisenor’s son, bespake the maids:﻿—



			 				“Come, some of you, at once, and sweep the floor,

				 				And sprinkle it, and on the shapely thrones

				 				Spread coverings of purple tapestry;

				 				Let others wipe the tables with a sponge,

				 				And cleanse the beakers and the double cups,

				 				While others go for water to the fount,

				 				And bring it quickly, for not long today

				 				The suitors will be absent from these halls.

				 				They will come early to the general feast.”



			 				She spake; the handmaids hearkened and obeyed,

				 				And twenty went to the dark well to draw

				 				The water, while the others busily

				 				Bestirred themselves about the house. Then came

				 				The servants of the chiefs, and set themselves

				 				Neatly to cleave the wood. Then also came

				 				The women from the well. The swineherd last

				 				Came with three swine, the fattest of the herd.

				 				In that fair court he let them feed, and sought

				 				Ulysses, greeting him with courteous words:﻿—



			 				“Hast thou, O stranger, found among these Greeks

				 				More reverence? Art thou still their mark of scorn?”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:

				 				“O that the gods, Eumaeus, would avenge

				 				The insolence of those who meditate

				 				Violent deeds, and make another’s house

				 				Their plotting-place, and feel no touch of shame!”



			 				So talked they with each other. Now appeared

				 				Melanthius, keeper of the goats. He brought

				 				Goats for the suitors’ banquet; they were choice

				 				Beyond all others. With him also came

				 				Two goatherds. In the echoing portico

				 				He bound his goats. He saw Ulvsses there,

				 				And thus accosted him with railing words:﻿—



			 				“Stranger, art thou still here, the palace pest,

				 				And begging still, and wilt thou ne’er depart?

				 				We shall not end this quarrel, I perceive,

				 				Till thou hast tried the flavor of my fist

				 				It is not decent to be begging here

				 				Continually; the Greeks have other feasts.”



			 				He spake; Ulysses answered not, but shook

				 				His head in silence, planning fearful things.



			 				Philoetius now, a master-herdsman, came,

				 				And for the banquet of the suitors led

				 				A heifer that had never yeaned, and goats

				 				The fatlings of the flock; they came across

				 				The ferry, brought by those whose office is

				 				To bear whoever comes from shore to shore.

				 				He bound his animals in the sounding porch,

				 				And went and, standing by the swineherd, said:﻿—



			 				“Who, swineherd, is the stranger newly come

				 				To this our palace? of what parents born,

				 				And of what race, and where his native land?

				 				Unhappy seemingly, yet like a king

				 				In person. Sorrowful must be the lot

				 				Of men who wander to and fro on earth,

				 				When even to kings the gods appoint distress.”



			 				He spake, and, greeting with his offered hand

				 				Ulysses, said in winged words aloud:﻿—



			 				“Stranger and father, hail! and mayst thou yet

				 				Be happy in the years to come at least,

				 				Though held in thrall by many sorrows now.

				 				Yet thou, All-father Jove! art most austere

				 				Of all the gods, not sparing even those

				 				Who have their birth from thee, but bringing them

				 				To grief and pain. The sweat is on my brow

				 				When I behold this stranger, and my eyes

				 				Are filled with tears when to my mind comes back

				 				The image of Ulysses, who must now,

				 				I think, be wandering, clothed in rags like thee,

				 				Among the abodes of men, if yet indeed

				 				He lives and sees the sweet light of the sun.

				 				But if that he be dead, and in the abode

				 				Of Pluto, woe is me for his dear sake!

				 				The blameless chief, who when I was a boy

				 				Gave to me, in the Cephalenian fields,

				 				The charge of all his beeves; and they are now

				 				Innumerable; the broad-fronted race

				 				Of cattle never would have multiplied

				 				So largely under other care than mine.

				 				Now other masters bid me bring my beeves

				 				For their own feasts. They little heed his son,

				 				The palace-heir; as little do they dread

				 				The vengeance of the gods; they long to share

				 				Among them the possessions of the king,

				 				So many years unheard from. But this thought

				 				Comes to my mind again, and yet again:

				 				Wrong were it, while the son is yet alive,

				 				To drive the cattle to a foreign land,

				 				Where alien men inhabit; yet ’tis worse

				 				To stay and tend another’s beeves, and bear

				 				This spoil. And long ago would I have fled

				 				To some large-minded monarch, since this waste

				 				Is not to be endured, but that I think

				 				Still of my suffering lord, and hope that yet

				 				He may return and drive the suitors hence.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answering, said:

				 				“Herdsman, since thou dost seem not ill inclined,

				 				Nor yet unwise, and I perceive in thee

				 				A well-discerning mind, I therefore say,

				 				And pledge my solemn oath﻿—Jove, first of gods,

				 				Be witness, and this hospitable board

				 				And hearth of good Ulysses, which has here

				 				Received me﻿—while thou art within these halls

				 				Ulysses will assuredly return,

				 				And, if thou choose to look, thine eyes shall see

				 				The suitors slain, who play the master here.”



			 				And thus the master of the herds rejoined:

				 				“Stranger, may Jupiter make good thy words!

				 				Then shalt thou see what strength is in my arm.”



			 				Eumaeus also prayed to all the gods,

				 				That now the wise Ulysses might return.

				 				So talked they with each other, while apart

				 				The suitors doomed Telemachus to death,

				 				And plotted how to take his life. Just then

				 				A bird﻿—an eagle﻿—on the left flew by,

				 				High up; his talons held a timid dove.

				 				And then Amphinomus bespake the rest:﻿—



			 				“O friends, this plan to slay Telemachus

				 				Must fail. And now repair we to the feast.”



			 				So spake Amphinomus, and to his words

				 				They all gave heed, and hastened to the halls

				 				Of the divine Ulysses, where they laid

				 				Their cloaks upon the benches and the thrones,

				 				And slaughtering the choice sheep, and fading goats,

				 				And porkers, and a heifer from the herd,

				 				Roasted the entrails, and distributed

				 				A share to each. Next mingled they the wine

				 				In the large bowls. The swineherd brought a cup

				 				To everyone. Philoetius, chief among

				 				The servants, gave from shapely canisters

				 				The bread to each. Melanthius poured the wine.

				 				Then putting forth their hands, they all partook

				 				The ready banquet. With a wise design,

				 				Telemachus near the stone threshold placed

				 				Ulysses, on a shabby seat, beside

				 				A little table, but within the walls

				 				Of that strong-pillared pile. He gave him there

				 				Part of the entrails, and poured out for him

				 				The wine into a cup of gold, and said:﻿—



			 				“Sit here, and drink thy wine among the rest,

				 				And from the insults and assaults of these

				 				It shall be mine to guard thee. For this house

				 				Is not the common property of all;

				 				Ulysses first acquired it, and for me﻿—

				 				And you, ye suitors, keep your tongues from taunts

				 				And hands from force, lest there be wrath and strife.”



			 				He spake; the suitors, as they heard him, bit

				 				Their pressed lips, wondering at Telemachus,

				 				Who uttered such bold words. Antinoüs then,

				 				Eupeithes’ son, bespake his fellows thus:﻿—



			 				“Harsh as they are, let us, O Greeks, endure

				 				These speeches of Telemachus. He makes

				 				High threats, but had Saturnian Jove allowed,

				 				We should, ere this, and in these very halls,

				 				Have quieted our loud-tongued orator.”



			 				So spake the suitor, but Telemachus

				 				Heeded him not. Then through the city came

				 				The heralds with a hallowed hecatomb,

				 				Due to the gods. The long-haired people thronged

				 				The shady grove of Phoebus, archer-god.



			 				Now when the flesh was roasted and was drawn

				 				From off the spits, and each was given his share,

				 				They held high festival. The men who served

				 				The banquet gave Ulysses, where he sat,

				 				A portion equal to their own, for so

				 				His own dear son Telemachus enjoined.



			 				Yet did not Pallas cause the haughty crew

				 				Of suitors to refrain from stinging taunts,

				 				That so the spirit of Laertes’ son

				 				Might be more deeply wounded. One there was

				 				Among the suitors, a low-thoughted wretch;

				 				Ctesippus was his name, and his abode

				 				Was Samos. Trusting in his father’s wealth,

				 				He wooed the wife of the long-absent king

				 				Ulysses. To his insolent mates he said:﻿—



			 				“Hear me, ye noble suitors, while I speak.

				 				This stranger has received an equal share,

				 				As is becoming; for it were not just

				 				Nor seemly to pass by, in such a feast,

				 				The guests, whoe’er they may be, that resort

				 				To this fair mansion of Telemachus.

				 				I also will bestow on him a gift

				 				Of hospitality, and he in turn

				 				May give it to the keeper of the bath,

				 				Or any other of the menial train

				 				That serve the household of Ulysses here.”



			 				So speaking, with his strong right hand he flung

				 				A bullock’s foot, which from a canister

				 				Hard by he plucked. Ulysses gently bowed

				 				His head, and shunned the blow, and grimly smiled.

				 				The missile struck the solid wall, and then

				 				Telemachus rebuked the suitor thus:﻿—



			 				“Ctesippus, well hast thou escaped with life,

				 				Not having hit the stranger, who himself

				 				Shrank from the blow; else had I pinned thee through

				 				With my sharp spear. Instead of wedding feast,

				 				Thy father would have celebrated here

				 				Thy funeral rites. Let no man in these halls

				 				Bear himself insolently in my sight

				 				Hereafter, for my reason now is ripe

				 				To know the right from wrong. I was of late

				 				A child, and now it is enough to bear

				 				That ye should slay our sheep, and drink our wine,

				 				And eat our bread﻿—for what can one man do

				 				Against so many? Cease this petty war

				 				Of wrong and hatred; but if ye desire

				 				To take my life, ’tis well; ’twere better so.

				 				And rather would I die by violence

				 				Than live to see these most unmanly deeds﻿—

				 				Guests driven away, and women-servants hauled

				 				Through these fair rooms by brutal wassailers.”



			 				He ended, and the assembly all sat mute

				 				Till Agelaüs spake, Damastor’s son:﻿—



			 				“O friends! let no man here with carping words

				 				Gainsay what is so rightly said, nor yet

				 				Insult the stranger more, nor one of those

				 				Who serve the household of the godlike chief

				 				Ulysses in his palace. I would say

				 				This word in kindness to Telemachus

				 				And to his mother; may it please them both!

				 				While yet the hope was cherished in your hearts

				 				That wise Ulysses would return, no blame

				 				Could fasten on the queen that she remained

				 				Unwedded, and resisted those who came

				 				To woo her in the palace. Better so,

				 				Had he come home again. Yet now, ’tis clear,

				 				He comes no more. Go then, Telemachus,

				 				And, sitting by thy mother, bid her wed

				 				The noblest of her wooers, and the one

				 				Who brings the richest gifts; and thou possess

				 				Thy father’s wealth in peace, and eat and drink

				 				At will, while she shall find another home.”



			 				And thus discreet Telemachus replied:

				 				“Nay, Agelaüs, for I swear by Jove,

				 				And by my father’s sufferings, who has died,

				 				Or yet is wandering, far from Ithaca,

				 				That I do nothing to delay the choice

				 				And marriage of my mother. I consent

				 				That she become the wife of whom she list,

				 				And him who offers most. But I should feel

				 				Great shame to thrust her forth against her will,

				 				And with unfllial speeches; God forbid!”



			 				He ended here, and Pallas, as he spake,

				 				To inextinguishable laughter moved

				 				The suitors. There they sat with wandering minds;

				 				They swallowed morsels foul with blood; their eyes

				 				Were filled with tears; their hearts foreboded woe.

				 				Then spake the godlike Theoclymenus:﻿—



			 				“Unhappy men! what may this evil be

				 				That overtakes you? Every brow and face

				 				And each one’s lower limbs are wrapped in night,

				 				And moans arise, and tears are on your cheeks.

				 				The walls and all the graceful cornices

				 				Between the pillars are bedropped with blood,

				 				The portico is full, these halls are full

				 				Of shadows, hastening down to Erebus

				 				Amid the gloom. The sun is blotted out

				 				From heaven, and fearful darkness covers all.”



			 				He spake, and loud they laughed. Eurymachus,

				 				The son of Polybus, in answer said:﻿—



			 				“The stranger prattles idly; he is come

				 				From some far land. Conduct him through the door,

				 				Young men, and send him to the marketplace,

				 				Since all things here are darkened to his eyes.”



			 				Then spake the godlike Theoclymenus:

				 				“Eurymachus, from thee I ask no guide,

				 				For I have eyes and ears, and two good feet,

				 				And in my breast a mind as sound as they,

				 				And by the aid of these I mean to make

				 				My way without; for clearly I perceive

				 				A coming evil, which no suitor here

				 				Will yet escape﻿—no one who, in these halls

				 				Of the great chief, Ulysses, treats with scorn

				 				His fellow-man, and broods o’er guilty plans.”



			 				He spake, and, hastening from that noble pile,

				 				Came to Piraeus, in whose house he found

				 				A welcome. All the suitors, as he went,

				 				Looked at each other, and, the more to vex

				 				Telemachus, kept laughing at his guests.

				 				And thus an insolent youth among them said:﻿—



			 				“No man had ever a worse set of guests

				 				Than thou, Telemachus. For what a wretch

				 				That wandering beggar is, who always wants

				 				His bread and wine, and is unfit for work,

				 				And has no strength; in truth, a useless load

				 				Upon the earth he treads. The other guest

				 				Rises to play the prophet. If thou take

				 				My counsel, which I give thee for thy good,

				 				Let them at once be put on board a barque

				 				Of many oars, and we will send them hence

				 				To the Sicilians; they will bring a price.”



			 				So talked the suitors, but he heeded not

				 				Their words, and, looking toward his father, held

				 				His peace, expecting when he would lay hands

				 				Upon that insolent crew. Penelope,

				 				Sage daughter of Icarius, took her place

				 				Right opposite upon a sumptuous seat,

				 				And heard the words of every man who spake

				 				Within the hall. They held that midday feast

				 				With laughter﻿—a luxurious feast it was,

				 				And mirthful; many victims had been slain

				 				To furnish forth the tables; but no feast

				 				Could be more bitter than the later one,

				 				To which the goddess and that valiant man

				 				Would bid the guilty crew of plotters soon.





						Book 						XXI


					The Bending of the Bow of Ulysses


				 				Proposal of Penelope to the suitors to contend for her hand with the bow and arrows of Ulysses﻿—Their ineffectual attempts to bend the bow﻿—Management of Ulysses to obtain the bow, which he bends with ease, and sends an arrow through the twelve rings set up in a row for the purpose.





				Pallas, the goddess of the azure eyes,

				 				Woke in the mind of sage Penelope,

				 				The daughter of Icarius, this design﻿—

				 				To put into the suitors’ hands the bow

				 				And gray steel rings, and to propose a game

				 				That in the palace was to usher in

				 				The slaughter. So she climbed the lofty stair,

				 				Up from the hall, and took in her plump hand

				 				The fair carved key; its wards were wrought of brass,

				 				And ivory was the handle. Soon she reached

				 				The furthest room with her attendant maids.

				 				There lay the treasures of Ulysses﻿—brass

				 				And gold, and steel divinely wrought. There lay

				 				His bow unstrung; there lay his quiver charged

				 				With arrows; many were the deadly shafts

				 				It held, a stranger’s gift, who met him once

				 				In Lacedaemon, Iphitus by name,

				 				The son of Eurytus, and like the gods

				 				In presence. In Messenè met the twain,

				 				And in the mansion of Orsilochus,

				 				The warlike. Thither had Ulysses come

				 				To claim a debt from all the region round;

				 				For rovers from Messene to their ships

				 				Had driven and carried off from Ithaca

				 				Three hundred sheep and those who tended them.

				 				For this Ulysses, though a stripling yet,

				 				Came that long voyage, on an embassy,

				 				Sent by his father and the other chiefs.

				 				And Iphitus had come in search of steeds

				 				Which he had lost﻿—twelve mares, and under them

				 				Twelve hardy mules, their foals. That errand brought

				 				The doom of death upon him. For he came,

				 				In journeying, to the abode of Hercules,

				 				The mighty hero-son of Jupiter,

				 				Famed for his labors, who, in his own house,

				 				Slew Iphitus, the stranger. Cruel wretch!

				 				Who reverenced not the vengeance of the gods,

				 				Nor what was due to his own board, at which

				 				He placed his guest, and slew him afterward,

				 				And in his stables kept the goodly mares.

				 				’Twas when this guest was seeking for his steeds

				 				He met Ulysses, and bestowed on him

				 				The bow, which mighty Eurytus once bore,

				 				And dying in his lofty palace left

				 				The weapon to his son. Ulysses gave

				 				In turn a trenchant sword and massive lance,

				 				A pledge of kindly hospitality,

				 				Begun, but not continued till they sat

				 				Each at the other’s table; for the son

				 				Of Jove first took the life of him who gave

				 				The bow, the godlike son of Eurytus.

				 				That bow Ulysses, when he went to war

				 				In his black galleys, never took with him,

				 				But left it in his palace, to be kept

				 				In memory of a beloved friend,

				 				And only bore it in his own domain.



			 				Now when the glorious lady reached the room,

				 				And stood upon the threshold, wrought of oak

				 				And polished by the workman’s cunning hand,

				 				Who stretched the line upon it, and set up

				 				Its posts, and hung its shining doors, she loosed

				 				With a quick touch the thong that held the ring.

				 				Put in the key, and with a careful aim

				 				Struck back the sounding bolts. As when a bull

				 				Roars in the field, such sound the beautiful doors,

				 				Struck with the key, gave forth, and instantly

				 				They opened to her. Up the lofty floor

				 				She stepped, where stood the coffer that contained

				 				The perfumed garments. Reaching forth her hand,

				 				The queen took down the bow, that hung within

				 				Its shining case, and sat her down, and laid

				 				The case upon her knees, and, drawing forth

				 				The monarch’s bow, she wept aloud. As soon

				 				As that new gush of tears had ceased to fall,

				 				Back to the hall she went, and that proud throng

				 				Of suitors, bearing in her hand the bow

				 				Unstrung, and quiver, where the arrows lay

				 				Many and deadly. Her attendant maids

				 				Brought also down a coffer, where were laid

				 				Much brass and steel, provided by the king

				 				For games like these. The glorious lady then,

				 				In presence of the suitors, stood beside

				 				The columns that upheld the stately roof.

				 				She held a lustrous veil before her cheeks,

				 				And, while on either side of her a maid

				 				Stood modestly, bespake the suitors thus:﻿—



			 				“Hear, noble suitors! ye who throng these halls,

				 				And eat and drink from day to day, while long

				 				My husband has been gone; your sole excuse

				 				For all this lawlessness the claim ye make

				 				That I become a bride. Come then, for now

				 				A contest is proposed. I bring to you

				 				The mighty bow that great Ulysses bore.

				 				Whoe’er among you he may be whose hand

				 				Shall bend this bow, and send through these twelve rings

				 				An arrow, him I follow hence, and leave

				 				This beautiful abode of my young years,

				 				With all its plenty﻿—though its memory,

				 				I think, will haunt me even in my dreams.”



			 				She spake, and bade the master of the swine,

				 				The good Eumaeus, place the bow and rings

				 				Of hoary steel before the suitor-train.

				 				In tears he bore the bow and laid it down.

				 				The herdsman also wept to see again

				 				His master’s bow. Antinoüs called to both

				 				With a loud voice, and chid them angrily:﻿—



			 				“Ye silly rustics, who can never see

				 				Beyond the hour, why trouble with your tears

				 				The lady who had grief enough besides

				 				For her lost husband? Sit and share the feast

				 				In silence, or go forth and leave the bow;

				 				A difficult contest it will be for us,

				 				Nor, as I think, will this fair bow be bent

				 				With ease, since surely there is no man here

				 				Such as Ulysses was. I saw him once,

				 				While but a child, and still remember him.”



			 				He spake, yet in his secret heart believed

				 				That he should bend the bow, and send a shaft

				 				Through all the rings. And yet he was the first

				 				To taste the steel﻿—an arrow from the hand

				 				Of the great chief Ulysses﻿—whom he wronged

				 				In his own palace, and to equal wrong

				 				Encouraged others. Then Telemachus

				 				Rose in his sacred might, and thus began:﻿—



			 				“Alas! it must be that Saturnian Jove

				 				Has made me lose my wits. Wise as she is,

				 				My mother promises to leave her home

				 				And follow someone else, and yet I laugh,

				 				And am delighted in my foolish heart.

				 				Come then, since such a contest is proposed,

				 				Ye suitors! and for such a woman too.

				 				The like is not in all the lands of Greece,

				 				Argos, Mycenae, or the hallowed shore

				 				Of Pylos, or in Ithaca itself,

				 				Or the dark mainland coast. Ye know it well;

				 				Why should I praise my mother? Come then, all;

				 				Let there be no excuses for delay,

				 				Nor longer leave the bow untried, that we

				 				May see the event. I too am moved to try;

				 				And if I bend the bow, and send a shaft

				 				Through all the rings, my gracious mother then

				 				Will not, to my great grief, renounce her home,

				 				And, following another, leave me here,

				 				Although my prowess even now might win

				 				The glorious prizes that my father won.”



			 				He spake and, rising, from his shoulders took

				 				The purple cloak, and laid the trenchant sword

				 				Aside; and first he placed the rings of steel

				 				In order, opening for them in the ground

				 				A long trench by a line, and stamping close

				 				The earth around them. All admired the skill

				 				With which he ranged them, never having seen

				 				The game before. And then he took his place

				 				Upon the threshold, and essayed the bow;

				 				And thrice he made the attempt, and thrice gave o’er,

				 				Yet hoping still to draw the cord, and send

				 				An arrow through the rings. He would have drawn

				 				The bow at the fourth trial, but a nod

				 				Given by his father caused him to forbear,

				 				Though eager for the attempt. And then again

				 				The princely youth bespake the suitors thus:﻿—



			 				“Well, this is strange! I may hereafter prove

				 				A craven and a weakling, or perchance

				 				Am yet too young, and cannot trust my arm

				 				To do me right against the man who first

				 				Assaults me. Come then, ye whose strength excels

				 				My own, and try the bow, and end the strife.”



			 				He spake, and setting down the bow to lean

				 				Against the firm smooth panels of the wall,

				 				And the swift shaft against the bow’s fair curve,

				 				He took again his seat upon the throne

				 				From which he rose. And then Eupeithes’ son,

				 				Antinoüs, to the crowd of suitors said:﻿—



			 				“Rise one by one, my friends, from right to left.

				 				Begin where he begins who pours the wine.”



			 				So spake Antinoüs, and the rest approved.

				 				Then rose Leiodes, son of Oenops, first.

				 				He was their seer, and always had his seat

				 				Beside the ample bowl. From deeds of wrong

				 				He shrank with hatred, and was sore incensed

				 				Against the suitors all. He took the bow

				 				And shaft, and, going to the threshold, stood

				 				And tried the bow, yet bent it not; it galled

				 				His hands, for they were soft, and all unused

				 				To such a task; and thus at length he spake:﻿—



			 				“O friends, I bend it not; another hand

				 				Must try. This bow, upon this very spot,

				 				Will take from many a prince the breath of life.

				 				And better were it thus to die, by far,

				 				Than, living, fail of that intent for which

				 				We haunt this place, and still from day to day

				 				Assemble. There is many a one whose wish

				 				And hope are strong to wed Penelope,

				 				The consort of Ulysses; but so soon

				 				As he shall see and try the hero’s bow

				 				Let him with marriage presents seek to gain

				 				Some other bride among the long-robed dames,

				 				Achaia’s daughters. Let him leave the queen

				 				To wed the suitor who shall bring to her

				 				The richest gifts, and him whom fate appoints.”



			 				He spake, and setting down the bow to lean

				 				Against the firm smooth panels of the wall,

				 				And the swift shaft against the bow’s fair curve,

				 				He took again bis seat upon the throne

				 				From which he rose. Antinoüs then took up

				 				The word and answered, and reproached him thus:﻿—



			 				“What words are these, Leiodes, that have passed

				 				Thy lips? harsh words and fearful﻿—that this bow

				 				Shall take from many princes here the breath

				 				Of life, and all because thou hast no power

				 				To bend it? Thy good mother bore thee not

				 				To draw the bow and send the arrow forth,

				 				But others of the noble suitor-train

				 				Are here, by whom this bow shall yet be bent.”



			 				Then to Melanthius, keeper of the goats,

				 				Antinoüs gave this bidding. “Light a fire

				 				With speed, Melanthius, in the palace here,

				 				And place a seat before it. Lay a fleece

				 				Upon the seat, and bring us from within

				 				An ample roll of fat, that we young men

				 				By warming and anointing may make soft

				 				The bow, and draw the cord, and end the strife.”



			 				He spake; Melanthius kindled instantly

				 				A glowing fire, and near it placed a seat,

				 				And on the seat a fleece, and from within

				 				Brought forth an ample roll of fat, with which

				 				The young men, having warmed it, smeared the bow

				 				And tried, but bent it not, too weak by far

				 				For such a feat. Antinoüs kept aloof,

				 				He and the godlike youth Eurymachus

				 				Two princes who in might excelled the rest.



			 				The herdsman of Ulysses meantime left

				 				The palace, and with him the swineherd went,

				 				And after them Ulysses. When they all

				 				Were now without the gate and palace court,

				 				Ulysses spake to them, and blandly said:﻿—



			 				“Herdsman and swineherd, shall I say to you

				 				Somewhat, or shall I keep it back? My heart

				 				Moves me to say it. Should Ulysses come,

				 				Led by some god, and suddenly, what aid

				 				Would he receive from you? Would ye take part

				 				With him, or with the suitors? Frankly speak;

				 				And tell me what your hearts would bid you do.”



			 				Then answered thus the keeper of the herds:

				 				“O Father Jove! wouldst thou but grant my wish,

				 				And let some god conduct him hither, then

				 				Shall it be seen what might is in these hands!”



			 				So also did Eumaeus offer prayer

				 				To all the deities, that speedily

				 				The wise Ulysses might return; and when

				 				The chief perceived in all its truth the thought

				 				And purpose of their hearts, he spake and said:﻿—



			 				“Know, then, that I myself am he, at home

				 				Again, returning in the twentieth year,

				 				And after many sufferings, to the land

				 				That saw my birth. I know that I am come

				 				Welcome to you alone of all my train

				 				Of servants, since I hear no others pray

				 				For my return. Hear, then, what I engage

				 				Shall be hereafter. If some god o’ercome

				 				For me these arrogant suitors, I will give

				 				To each of you a wife and lands, and build

				 				For each a house near mine, and ye shall be

				 				The friends and brothers of Telemachus

				 				Thenceforth. And now, that ye may surely know

				 				And trust me, I will show a token here﻿—

				 				A scar which once the white tooth of a boar

				 				Made, when long since, on the Parnassian mount,

				 				I hunted with Autolycus’s sons.”



			 				Thus having said, he drew from the broad scar

				 				The covering rags; they looked and knew it well,

				 				And wept, and round Ulysses threw their arms,

				 				And kissed in that embrace the hero’s head

				 				And shoulders, while Ulysses also kissed

				 				Their heads and hands. The sun would have gone down

				 				Upon their weeping, but for him. He said:﻿—



			 				“Cease now from tears, lest someone from the hall

				 				Should see us, and report of us within.

				 				Now let us enter, not in company﻿—

				 				I first, and ye thereafter, one by one,

				 				And let the sign be this: the others all﻿—

				 				The haughty suitors﻿—will refuse to me

				 				The bow and quiver. When thou bearest it,

				 				My noble friend Eumaeus, through the halls,

				 				Bring it and place it in my hands, and charge

				 				The women to make fast the solid doors;

				 				And then if any one of them should hear

				 				A groan or other noise of men within,

				 				Let her not issue forth, but silently

				 				Pursue her task. Meantime be it thy care,

				 				My good Philoetius, with a key to lock

				 				The portals of the court and fix the chain.”



			 				Thus having said, into that noble pile

				 				He passed again, and took the seat from which

				 				He lately rose, and afterward, in turn,

				 				Entered the servants of the godlike chief.



			 				Eurymachus was busy with the bow,

				 				Turning and warming it before the blaze

				 				On both its sides. He could not bend it thus.

				 				There came a deep sigh from his boastful heart,

				 				And greatly was he vexed, and sadly said:﻿—



			 				“Alas! great cause of grief indeed is here

				 				For me and all. ’Tis not that I lament

				 				So much the losing of the bride, although

				 				That also vexes me﻿—there yet remain

				 				Many fair ladies of the Achaian stock,

				 				Both in the seagirt lands of Ithaca

				 				And other regions﻿—yet if we be found

				 				To fall in strength of arm so far below

				 				The great Ulysses that we cannot bend

				 				His bow, our sons will hear of it with shame.”



			 				Eupeithes’ son, Antinoüs, answered thus:

				 				“Not so, Eurymachus, as thou thyself

				 				Shouldst know. This day is held a solemn feast

				 				Of Phoebus by the people. Who would draw

				 				The bow today? Nay, lay it by in peace,

				 				And suffer all the rings to stand as now;

				 				For no man, as I think, will dare to come

				 				Into the palace of Laertes’ son

				 				And take them hence. Let him who bears the cup

				 				Begin to serve the wine, that, having poured

				 				Part to the gods, we may lay down the bow,

				 				And with the morning let Melanthius come﻿—

				 				The goatherd﻿—bringing with him from the flock

				 				The choicest goats, that we may burn the thighs,

				 				An offering to the god of archery,

				 				Apollo. Then will we again essay

				 				The bow, and bring the contest to an end.”



			 				So spake Antinoüs, and they all approved.

				 				Then heralds came, and on the suitors’ hands

				 				Poured water; youths filled up the cups with wine,

				 				Beginning at the right, and gave to each

				 				His share; and when they all had poured a part,

				 				And each had drunk, the shrewd Ulysses thus

				 				With artful speech bespake the suitor-train:﻿—



			 				“Hearken, ye suitors of the illustrious queen,

				 				To what ray heart is prompting me to say;

				 				But chiefly to Eurymachus I make

				 				My suit, and to Antinoüs, who so well

				 				Hath counselled to lay by the bow and trust

				 				The gods. Tomorrow Phoebus will bestow

				 				The needed strength on whomsoe’er he will;

				 				But let me take that polished bow, and try

				 				Among you, whether still the power that dwelt

				 				In these once pliant limbs abides in them,

				 				Or whether happily it has passed from me

				 				Amid my wanderings and a life of want.”



			 				He spake, and all were vehemently moved

				 				With anger, for they feared that he would bend

				 				The bow, and thus Antinoüs, railing, spake:﻿—



			 				“Thou worthless vagabond, without a spark

				 				Of reason, art thou not content to sit

				 				And banquet with the proudest, where no part

				 				Of all the feast escapes thee, hearing all

				 				That we are saying, which no other man,

				 				Stranger and beggar, is allowed to hear!

				 				This good wine makes thee foolish, as wine oft

				 				Makes those who swallow it too greedily,

				 				And drink not with due stint. It maddened once

				 				Eurytion, the famed Centaur, in the halls

				 				Of the large-souled Pirithoüs. He had come

				 				Among the Lapithae, and when inflamed

				 				With wine to madness, in those very halls

				 				Did lawless deeds. The heroes were incensed.

				 				They rushed upon him, dragged him through the porch

				 				And out of doors, and there cut off his nose

				 				And ears, and he departed, frenzied still,

				 				And bearing in bewilderment of mind

				 				His punishment, whence war arose between

				 				Centaurs and men; yet surely he had brought

				 				The evil on himself, when overcome

				 				With wine. Such fearful mischief I foretell

				 				Will light on thee, if thou shouldst bend this bow,

				 				Nor canst thou hope for favor here among

				 				The people. We will send thee speedily,

				 				In a black galley, to King Echetus,

				 				The enemy of human kind, from whom

				 				Thou shalt find no escape. Drink, then, in peace

				 				Thy wine, and seek no strife with younger men.”



			 				Then spake the sage Penelope again:

				 				“Truly, Antinoüs, it becomes thee not,

				 				Nor is it just, to vex the stranger guests

				 				Who seek the palace of Telemachus.

				 				Dost thou, then, think that, should this stranger bend,

				 				Proud as he is of his great strength of arm,

				 				The mighty bow that once Ulysses bore,

				 				He leads me hence a bride? No hope of that

				 				Is in his heart, and let no one of you

				 				Who banquet here allow a thought like that

				 				To vex him; ’tis a thing that cannot be.”



			 				Then to the queen, Eurymachus, the son

				 				Of Polybus, replied: “We do not fear,

				 				Sage daughter of Icarius, that this man

				 				Will lead thee hence a bride; it cannot be.

				 				We fear the speech of men and women both.

				 				The very meanest of the Achaian race

				 				Will say: ‘Degenerate men are these, who seek

				 				To wed the consort of a glorious chief,

				 				Not one of whom can draw the bow he bore;

				 				And now there comes a wandering beggar-man,

				 				Who draws the bow with ease, and sends a shaft

				 				Through all the rings of steel.’ Thus will they speak,

				 				And this will be to us a cause of shame!”



			 				And then the sage Penelope rejoined:

				 				“Eurymachus, it cannot be that those

				 				Should earn the general praise who make the wealth

				 				Of a most worthy man their spoil, and bring

				 				Dishonor on his house. The stranger’s frame

				 				Is powerful and well knit; he claims to be

				 				Of noble parentage. Now let him take

				 				The bow, and we will see the event; but this

				 				I promise, and will make my promise good,

				 				If he should bend it﻿—if Apollo give

				 				To him that glory﻿—he shall have from me

				 				A tunic and a cloak, fair garments both,

				 				And a keen javelin, his defence against

				 				Both dogs and men, a two-edged sword besides,

				 				And sandals for his feet, and I engage

				 				To send him whither he desires to go.”



			 				Then spake discreet Telemachus again:

				 				“Mother, in all Achaia there is none

				 				Who has more power than I can claim, to grant

				 				Or to deny the bow to whom I will.

				 				No one of those who rule the rugged coast

				 				Of Ithaca, or isles where Elis breeds

				 				Her mares, may interpose to thwart my will,

				 				If on the stranger I bestow the bow

				 				To be his own, and bid him take it hence.

				 				Withdraw, O queen, into thy bower; direct

				 				Thy household tasks, the distaff and the web,

				 				And bid thy maidens speed the work. The bow

				 				Belongs to men, and most to me; for here,

				 				Within these walls, the authority is mine.”



			 				The queen, astonished, heard him and withdrew,

				 				But kept her son’s wise sayings in her heart

				 				And then ascending to her bower, among

				 				Her maids, she wept her well-beloved lord,

				 				Ulysses, till the blue-eyed Pallas came,

				 				And poured upon her lids the balm of sleep.



			 				Meantime the worthy swineherd bore the bow

				 				In hand, and all along the palace-halls

				 				The suitor-crew were chiding him aloud,

				 				And thus an insolent youth among them spake:﻿—



			 				“Thou awkward swineherd, whither goest thou

				 				With the curved bow? Thy own fleet dogs which thou

				 				Hast reared shall soon devour thee, far from men

				 				And midst thy herds of swine, if we find grace

				 				With Phoebus and the other deathless gods.”



			 				Such were their words; the swineherd where he stood

				 				Set down the bow in fear, for many a voice

				 				Called to him in the hall. On the other side

				 				Shouted Telemachus with threatening words:﻿—



			 				“Nay, father, carry on the bow, nor think

				 				To stop at every man’s command; lest I,

				 				Though younger than thyself, cast stones at thee,

				 				And chase thee to the fields, for I in strength

				 				Excel thee. Would that I excelled as far

				 				In strength of arm the suitors in these halls,

				 				Then would I roughly through the palace-gates

				 				Drive many who are plotting mischief now.”



			 				He spake, and all with hearty laughter heard

				 				His words, and for their sake allowed their wrath

				 				Against the prince to cool. The swineherd went

				 				Forward, along the hall, and, drawing near

				 				The wise Ulysses, gave into his hands

				 				The bow; and then he called the nurse aside,

				 				Dame Eurycleia, and bespake her thus:﻿—



			 				“Sage Eurycleia, from Telemachus

				 				I charge thee to make fast the solid doors,

				 				And then, if any of the maids should hear

				 				A groan or other noise of men within,

				 				Let her not issue forth, but silently

				 				Pursue the task in hand, and keep her place.”



			 				He spake, nor were his words in vain. The dame

				 				Made fast the doors of that magnificent hall,

				 				While silently Philoetius hastened forth

				 				And locked the portals of the high-walled court.

				 				A cable of the barque of Byblos lay

				 				Beneath the portico﻿—it once had served

				 				A galley﻿—and with this the herdsman tied

				 				The portals, and, returning, took the seat

				 				Whence he had risen, but ever kept his eye

				 				Fixed on his lord. Ulysses, meantime, held

				 				The bow, and, turning it, intently eyed

				 				Side after side, and tried each part in turn,

				 				For fear that worms, while he was far away,

				 				Had pierced the horn. At this, a youth among

				 				The suitors, turning to his neighbor, said:﻿—



			 				“Lo an inspector and a judge of bows!

				 				Perhaps he has a bow like that at home,

				 				Or else would make one like it. How he shifts

				 				The thing with busy hands from side to side﻿—

				 				The vagabond, well trained in knavish tricks!”



			 				Then also said another insolent youth:

				 				“May he in all things be as fortunate

				 				As now, when he shall try to bend that bow!”



			 				Such was their talk; but when the wary chief

				 				Had poised and shrewdly scanned the mighty bow,

				 				Then, as a singer, skilled to play the harp,

				 				Stretches with ease on its new fastenings

				 				A string, the twisted entrails of a sheep,

				 				Made fast at either end, so easily

				 				Ulysses bent that mighty bow. He took

				 				And drew the cord with his right hand; it twanged

				 				With a clear sound as when a swallow screams.

				 				The suitors were dismayed, and all grew pale.

				 				Jove in loud thunder gave a sign from heaven.

				 				The much-enduring chief, Ulysses, heard

				 				With joy the friendly omen, which the son

				 				Of crafty Saturn sent him. He took up

				 				A winged arrow, that before him lay

				 				Upon a table, drawn; the others still

				 				Were in the quiver’s womb; the Greeks were yet

				 				To feel them. This he set with care against

				 				The middle of the bow, and toward him drew

				 				The cord and arrow-notch, just where he sat,

				 				And, aiming opposite, let fly the shaft.

				 				He missed no ring of all; from first to last

				 				The brass-tipped arrow threaded every one.

				 				Then to Telemachus Ulysses said:﻿—



			 				“Telemachus, the stranger sitting here

				 				Hath not disgraced thee. I have neither missed

				 				The rings, nor found it hard to bend the bow;

				 				Nor has my manly strength decayed, as these

				 				Who seek to bring me to contempt pretend;

				 				And now the hour is come when we prepare

				 				A supper for the Achaians, while the day

				 				Yet lasts, and after supper the delights

				 				Of song and harp, which nobly grace a feast.”



			 				He spake, and nodded to Telemachus,

				 				His well-beloved son, who girded on

				 				His trenchant sword, and took in hand his spear,

				 				And, armed with glittering brass for battle, came

				 				And took his station by his father’s seat.





						Book 						XXII


					Death of the Suitors


				 				Antinoüs slain by an arrow from the bow of Ulysses, who now declares himself, and begins the slaughter﻿—Arms brought to him and to Eumaeus and Philoetius by Telemachus﻿—Arms brought to the suitors by Melanthius the goatherd﻿—Appearance of Pallas in the shape of Mentor﻿—Death of all the suitors﻿—Medon and Phemius spared﻿—The unfaithful serving-women hanged.





				Then did Ulysses cast his rags aside,

				 				And, leaping to the threshold, took his stand

				 				On its broad space, with bow and quiver filled

				 				With arrows. At his feet the hero poured

				 				The winged shafts, and to the suitors called:﻿—



			 				“That difficult strife is ended. Now I take

				 				Another mark, which no man yet has hit.

				 				Now shall I see if I attain my aim,

				 				And, by the aid of Phoebus, win renown.”



			 				He spake; and, turning, at Antinoüs aimed

				 				The bitter shaft﻿—Antinoüs, who just then

				 				Had grasped a beautiful two-eared cup of gold,

				 				About to drink the wine. He little thought

				 				Of wounds and death; for who, when banqueting

				 				Among his fellows, could suspect that one

				 				Alone against so many men would dare,

				 				However bold, to plan his death, and bring

				 				On him the doom of fate? Ulysses struck

				 				The suitor with the arrow at the throat.

				 				The point came through the tender neck behind,

				 				Sideways he sank to earth; his hand let fall

				 				The cup; the dark blood in a thick warm stream

				 				Gushed from the nostrils of the smitten man.

				 				He spurned the table with his feet, and spilled

				 				The viands; bread and roasted meats were flung

				 				To lie polluted on the floor. Then rose

				 				The suitors in a tumult, when they saw

				 				The fallen man; from all their seats they rose

				 				Throughout the hall, and to the massive walls

				 				Looked eagerly; there hung no buckler there,

				 				No sturdy lance for them to wield. They called

				 				Thus to Ulysses with indignant words:﻿—



			 				“Stranger! in evil hour hast thou presumed

				 				To aim at men; and thou shalt henceforth bear

				 				Part in no other contest. Even now

				 				Is thy destruction close to thee. Thy hand

				 				Hath slain the noblest youth in Ithaca.

				 				The vultures shall devour thy flesh for this.”



			 				So each one said; they deemed he had not slain

				 				The suitor wittingly; nor did they see,

				 				Blind that they were, the doom which in that hour

				 				Was closing round them all. Then with a frown

				 				The wise Ulysses looked on them, and said:﻿—



			 				“Dogs! ye had thought I never would come back

				 				From Ilium’s coast, and therefore ye devoured

				 				My substance here, and offered violence

				 				To my maidservants, and pursued my wife

				 				As lovers, while I lived. Ye dreaded not

				 				The gods who dwell in the great heaven, nor feared

				 				Vengeance hereafter from the hands of men;

				 				And now destruction overhangs you all.”



			 				He spake, and all were pale with fear, and each

				 				Looked round for some escape from death. Alone

				 				Eurymachus found voice, and answered thus:﻿—



			 				“If thou indeed be he, the Ithacan

				 				Ulysses, now returned to thine old home,

				 				Well hast thou spoken of the many wrongs

				 				Done to thee by the Achaians in thy house

				 				And in thy fields. But there the man lies slain

				 				Who was the cause of all. Antinoüs first

				 				Began this course of wrong. Nor were his thoughts

				 				So much of marriage as another aim﻿—

				 				Which Saturn’s son denied him﻿—to bear rule

				 				Himself o’er those who till the pleasant fields

				 				Of Ithaca, first having slain thy son

				 				In ambush. But he now has met his fate.

				 				Spare, then, thy people. We will afterward

				 				Make due amends in public for the waste

				 				Here in thy palace of the food and wine.

				 				For each of us shall bring thee twenty beeves,

				 				And brass and gold, until thy heart shall be

				 				Content. Till then we cannot blame thy wrath.”



			 				Sternly the wise Ulysses frowned, and said:

				 				“Eurymachus, if thou shouldst offer me

				 				All that thou hast, thy father’s wealth entire,

				 				And add yet other gifts, not even then

				 				Would I refrain from bloodshed, ere my hand

				 				Avenged my wrongs upon the suitor-crew.

				 				Choose then to fight or flee, whoever hopes

				 				Escape from death and fate; yet none of you

				 				Will now, I think, avoid that bitter doom.”



			 				He spake. At once their knees and head grew faint,

				 				And thus Eurymachus bespake the rest:﻿—



			 				“This man, O friends, to his untamable arm

				 				Will give no rest, but with that bow in hand,

				 				And quiver, will send forth from where he stands

				 				His shafts, till he has slain us all. Prepare

				 				For combat then, and draw your swords, and hold

				 				The tables up against his deadly shafts,

				 				And rush together at him as one man,

				 				And drive him from the threshold through the door.

				 				Then, hurrying through the city, let us sound

				 				The alarm, and soon he will have shot his last.”



			 				He spake, and, drawing his keen two-edged sword

				 				Of brass, sprang toward him with a dreadful cry,

				 				Just as the great Ulysses, sending forth

				 				An arrow, smote the suitor on the breast,

				 				Beside the nipple. The swift weapon stood

				 				Fixed in his liver; to the ground he flung

				 				The sword, and, reeling giddily around

				 				The table, fell; he brought with him to earth

				 				The viands and the double cup, and smote

				 				The pavement with his forehead heavily,

				 				And in great agony. With both his feet

				 				He struck and shook his throne, and darkness came

				 				Over his eyes. Then rushed Amphinomus

				 				Against the glorious chief, and drew his sword

				 				To thrust him from the door. Telemachus

				 				O’ertook him, and between his shoulders drove

				 				A brazen lance. Right through his breast it went,

				 				And he fell headlong, with his forehead dashed

				 				Against the floor. Telemachus drew back,

				 				And left his long spear in Amphinomus,

				 				Lest, while he drew it forth, someone among

				 				The Achaians might attack him with the sword,

				 				And thrust him through or hew him down. In haste

				 				He reached his father’s side, and quickly said:﻿—



			 				“Now, father, will I bring to thee a shield,

				 				Two javelins, and a helmet wrought of brass,

				 				Well fitted to the temples. I will case

				 				Myself in armor, and will also give

				 				Arms to the swineherd, and to him who tends

				 				The beeves; for men in armor combat best.”



			 				And wise Ulysses answered: “Bring them then,

				 				And quickly, while I yet have arrows here

				 				For my defence, lest, when I am alone,

				 				They drive me from my station at the door.”



			 				He spake. Obedient to his father’s word,

				 				Telemachus was soon within the room

				 				In which the glorious arms were laid. He took

				 				Four bucklers thence, eight spears, and helmets four

				 				Of brass, each darkened with its horsehair crest,

				 				And bore them forth, and quickly stood again

				 				Beside his father. But he first encased

				 				His limbs in brass; his followers also put

				 				Their shining armor on, and took their place

				 				Beside the wise Ulysses, eminent

				 				In shrewd devices. He, while arrows yet

				 				Were ready to his hand, with every aim

				 				Brought down a suitor; side by side they fell.

				 				But when the shafts were spent, the archer-king

				 				Leaned his good bow beside the shining wall,

				 				Against a pillar of the massive pile,

				 				And round his shoulders slung a fourfold shield,

				 				And crowned his martial forehead with a helm

				 				Wrought fairly, with a heavy horsehair crest

				 				That nodded gallantly above, and took

				 				In hand the two stout lances tipped with brass.



			 				In the strong wall there was a postern door,

				 				And, near the outer threshold of the pile,

				 				A passage from it to a narrow lane,

				 				Closed with well-fitting doors. Ulysses bade

				 				The noble swineherd take his station there.

				 				And guard it well, as now the only way

				 				Of entrance. Agelaüs called aloud

				 				To all his fellows, and bespake them thus:﻿—



			 				“Friends! will no one among you all go up

				 				To yonder postern door, and make our plight

				 				Known to the people? Then the alarm would spread,

				 				And this man haply will have shot his last.”



			 				Melanthius, keeper of the goats, replied:

				 				“Nay, noble Agelaüs; ’tis too near

				 				The palace gate; the entrance of the lane

				 				Is narrow, and a single man, if brave,

				 				Against us all might hold it. I will bring

				 				Arms from the chamber to equip you all;

				 				For there within, and nowhere else, I deem,

				 				Ulysses and his son laid up their arms.”



			 				Thus having said, the keeper of the goats,

				 				Melanthius, climbed the palace stairs, and gained

				 				The chamber of Ulysses. Taking thence

				 				Twelve shields, as many spears, as many helms

				 				Of brass, with each its heavy horsehair plume,

				 				He came, and gave them to the suitors’ hands.

				 				Then sank the hero’s heart, and his knees shook

				 				As he beheld the suitors putting on

				 				Their armor, and uplifting their long spears.

				 				The mighty task appalled him, and he thus

				 				Bespake Telemachus with winged words:﻿—



			 				“Telemachus, some woman here, or else

				 				Melanthius, makes the battle hard for us.”



			 				And thus discreet Telemachus replied:

				 				“Father, I erred in this. I was the cause,

				 				And no one else; I left the solid door

				 				Ajar; the spy was shrewder far than I.

				 				Now, good Eumaeus, shut the chamber door,

				 				And see if any of the palace-maids

				 				Have brought these arms, or if I rightly fix

				 				The guilt upon Melanthius, Dolius’ son.”



			 				So talked they with each other, while again

				 				Melanthius, stealing toward the chamber, thought

				 				To bring yet other shining weapons thence.

				 				The noble swineherd marked him as he went,

				 				And quickly drawing near Ulysses said:﻿—



			 				“Son of Laertes! nobly born and wise!

				 				The knave whom we suspect is on his way

				 				Up to thy chamber. Tell me now, I pray,

				 				And plainly, shall I make an end of him,

				 				If I may prove the stronger man, or bring

				 				The wretch into thy presence, to endure

				 				The vengeance due to all the iniquities

				 				Plotted by him against thee in these halls?”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:

				 				“Telemachus and I will keep at bay

				 				The suitors in this place, however fierce

				 				Their onset, while ye two bind fast his hands

				 				And feet behind his back, and bringing him

				 				Into the chamber, with the door made fast

				 				Behind you, tie him with a double cord,

				 				And draw him up a lofty pillar close

				 				To the timbers of the roof, that, swinging there,

				 				He may live long and suffer grievous pain.”



			 				He spake; they hearkened and obeyed, and went

				 				Up to the chamber unperceived by him

				 				Who stood within and searched a nook for arms.

				 				On each side of the entrance, by its posts,

				 				They waited for Melanthius. Soon appeared

				 				The goatherd at the threshold of the room,

				 				Bearing a beautiful helmet in one hand,

				 				And in the other a broad ancient shield,

				 				Defaced by age and mould. Laertes once,

				 				The hero, bore it when a youth, but now

				 				Long time it lay unused, with gaping seams.



			 				They sprang and seized the goatherd, dragging him

				 				Back to the chamber by the hair; and there

				 				They cast him, in an agony of fear,

				 				Upon the floor, and bound his hands and feet

				 				With a stout cord behind his back, as bade

				 				The great Ulysses, much-enduring son

				 				Of old Laertes. Round him then they looped

				 				A double cord, and swung him up beside

				 				A lofty pillar, till they brought him near

				 				The timbers of the roof. And then didst thou,

				 				Eumaeus, say to him in jeering words:﻿—



			 				“Melanthius, there mayst thou keep watch all night

				 				On a soft bed, a fitting place for thee;

				 				And when the Mother of the Dawn shall come

				 				Upon her golden seat from ocean’s streams,

				 				Thou wilt not fail to see her. Thou mayst then

				 				Drive thy goats hither for the suitors’ feast.”



			 				They left him in that painful plight, and put

				 				Their armor on, and closed the shining door,

				 				And went, and by Ulysses, versed in wiles,

				 				Stood breathing valor. Four were they who stood

				 				Upon that threshold, while their foes within

				 				Were many and brave. Then Pallas, child of Jove,

				 				Drew near, like Mentor both in shape and voice.

				 				Ulysses saw her, and rejoiced and said:﻿—



			 				“Come, Mentor, to the aid of one who loves

				 				And has befriended thee, thy peer in age.”



			 				Thus said Ulysses, but believed he spake

				 				To Pallas, scatterer of hosts. Fierce shouts

				 				Came from the suitors in the hall, and first,

				 				Thus Agelaüs railed, Damastor’s son:﻿—



			 				“Mentor, let not Ulysses wheedle thee

				 				To join him, and make war on us, for this

				 				Our purpose is, and it will be fulfilled:

				 				When by our hands the father and the son

				 				Are slain, thou also shalt be put to death

				 				For this attempt, and thy own head shall be

				 				The forfeit. When we shall have taken thus

				 				Thy life with our good weapons, we will seize

				 				On all thou hast, on all thy wealth within

				 				Thy dwelling or without, and, mingling it

				 				With the possessions of Ulysses, leave

				 				Within thy palaces no son of thine

				 				Or daughter living, and no virtuous wife

				 				Of thine, abiding here in Ithaca.”



			 				He spake, and woke new anger in the heart

				 				Of Pallas, and she chid Ulysses thus:﻿—



			 				“Ulysses, thou art not, in might of arm

				 				And courage, what thou wert when waging war

				 				Nine years without a pause against the men

				 				Of Troy for Helen’s sake, the child of Jove,

				 				And many didst thou slay in deadly strife,

				 				And Priam’s city, with its spacious streets,

				 				Was taken through thy counsels. How is it

				 				That, coming to thy own possessions here

				 				And thy own palace, thou dost sadly find

				 				Thy ancient valor fail thee in the strife

				 				Against the suitors? Now draw near, my friend,

				 				And stand by me, and see what I shall do,

				 				And own that Mentor, son of Alcimus,

				 				Amid a press of foes requites thy love.”



			 				She spake, but gave not to Ulysses yet

				 				The certain victory; for she meant to put

				 				To further proof the courage and the might

				 				Both of Ulysses and his emulous son.

				 				To the broad palace roof she rose, and sat

				 				In shape a swallow. Agelaüs now,

				 				Damastor’s son, cheered on with gallant words

				 				His friends; so also did Amphimedon,

				 				Eurynomus, and Demoptolemus,

				 				Polyctor’s son, Peisander, and with these

				 				Sagacious Polybus. These six excelled

				 				In valor all the suitors who survived,

				 				And they were fighting for their lives. The bow

				 				And the fleet shafts had smitten down their peers.

				 				Thus to his fellows Agelaüs spake:﻿—



			 				“O friends, this man will now be forced to stay

				 				His fatal hand. See, Mentor leaves his side,

				 				After much empty boasting, and those four

				 				Are at the entrance gate alone. Now aim

				 				At him with your long spears﻿—not all at once,

				 				Let six first hurl their weapons, and may Jove

				 				Grant that we strike Ulysses down, and win

				 				Great glory! For the others at his side

				 				We care but little, if their leader fail.”



			 				He spake; they hearkened. Eagerly they cast

				 				Their lances. Pallas made their aim to err.

				 				One struck a pillar of the massive pile;

				 				One struck the panelled door; one ashen shaft,

				 				Heavy with metal, rang against the wall.



			 				And when they had escaped that flight of spears,

				 				Hurled from the crowd, the much-enduring man,

				 				Ulysses, thus to his companions said:﻿—



			 				“Now is the time, my friends, to send our spears

				 				Into the suitor-crowd, who, not content

				 				With wrongs already done us, seek our lives.”



			 				He spake, and, aiming opposite, they cast

				 				Their spears. The weapon which Ulysses flung

				 				Slew Demoptolemus; his son struck down

				 				Euryades; the herdsman smote to death

				 				Peisander, and the swineherd Elatus.

				 				These at one moment fell, and bit the dust

				 				Of the broad floor. Back flew the suitor-crowd

				 				To a recess; and after them the four

				 				Rushed on, and plucked their weapons from the dead.



			 				Again the suitors threw their spears; again

				 				Did Pallas cause their aim to err. One struck

				 				A pillar of the massive pile, and one

				 				The panelled door; another ashen shaft,

				 				Heavy with metal, rang against the wall.

				 				Yet did the weapon of Amphimedon

				 				Strike lightly on the wrist Telemachus.

				 				The brass just tore the skin. Ctesippus grazed

				 				The shoulder of Eumaeus with his spear,

				 				Above the shield; the spear flew over it

				 				And fell to earth. Then they who stood beside

				 				The sage Ulysses, versed in wiles, once more

				 				Flung their keen spears. The spoiler of walled towns,

				 				Ulysses, slew Eurydamas; his son

				 				Struck down Amphimedon; the swineherd took

				 				The life of Polybus; the herdsman smote

				 				Ctesippus, driving through his breast the spear,

				 				And called to him, and gloried o’er his fall:﻿—



			 				“O son of Polytherses, prompt to rail!

				 				Beware of uttering, in thy foolish pride,

				 				Big words hereafter; leave it to the gods,

				 				Mightier are they than we. See, I repay

				 				The hospitable gift of a steer’s foot,

				 				Which once the great Ulysses from thy hand

				 				Received, as he was passing through this hall.”



			 				Thus spake the keeper of the horned herd.

				 				Meantime, Ulysses slew Damastor’s son

				 				With his long spear, in combat hand to hand

				 				Telemachus next smote Evenor’s son,

				 				Leiocritus. He sent the brazen spear

				 				Into his bowels; through his body passed

				 				The weapon, and he fell upon his face.

				 				His forehead struck the floor. Then Pallas held

				 				On high her fatal aegis. From the roof

				 				She showed it, and their hearts grew wild with fear.

				 				They fled along the hall as flees a herd

				 				Of kine, when the swift gadfly suddenly

				 				Has come among them, and has scattered them

				 				In springtime, when the days are growing long.

				 				Meantime, like falcons with curved claws and beaks,

				 				That, coming from the mountain summits, pounce

				 				Upon the smaller birds, and make them fly

				 				Close to the fields among the snares they dread,

				 				And seize and slay, nor can the birds resist

				 				Or fly, and at the multitude of prey

				 				The fowlers’ hearts are glad; so did the four

				 				Smite right and left the suitors hurrying through

				 				The palace-hall, and fearful moans arose

				 				As heads were smitten by the sword, and all

				 				The pavement swam with blood. Leiodes then

				 				Sprang forward to Ulysses, clasped his knees,

				 				And supplicated him with winged words:﻿—



			 				“I come, Ulysses, to thy knees. Respect

				 				And spare me. Never have I said or done,

				 				Among the women of thy household, aught

				 				That could be blamed, and I essayed to check

				 				The wrongs of other suitors. Little heed

				 				They gave my counsels, nor withheld their hands

				 				From evil deeds, and therefore have they drawn

				 				Upon themselves an evil fate. But I,

				 				Who have done nothing﻿—I their soothsayer﻿—

				 				Must I too die? Then is there no reward

				 				Among the sons of men for worthy deeds.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, frowned and said:

				 				“If then, in truth, thou wert as thou dost boast,

				 				A soothsayer among these men, thy prayer

				 				Within these palace-walls must oft have been

				 				That far from me might be the blessed day

				 				Of my return, and that my wife might take

				 				With thee her lot, and bring forth sons to thee,

				 				And therefore shalt thou not escape from death.”



			 				He spake, and seizing with his powerful hand

				 				A falchion lying near, which from the grasp

				 				Of Agelaüs fell when he was slain,

				 				Just at the middle of the neck he smote

				 				Leiodes, while the words were on his lips,

				 				And the head fell, and lay amid the dust.



			 				Phemius, the son of Terpius, skilled in song,

				 				Alone escaped the bitter doom of death.

				 				He by constraint had sung among the train

				 				Of suitors, and was standing now beside

				 				The postern door, and held his sweet-toned lyre,

				 				And pondered whether he should leave the hall,

				 				And sit before the altar of the great

				 				Herceian Jove, where, with Laertes, once

				 				Ulysses oft had burned the thighs of beeves,

				 				Or whether he should fling himself before

				 				Ulysses, as a suppliant, at his knees.

				 				This to his thought seemed wisest﻿—to approach

				 				Laertes’ son, and clasp his knees. He placed

				 				His sweet harp on the floor, between the cup

				 				And silver-studded seat, and went and clasped

				 				The hero’s knees, and said in winged words:﻿—



			 				“I come, Ulysses, to thy knees. Respect

				 				And spare me. It will be a grief to thee,

				 				Hereafter, shouldst thou slay a bard, who sings

				 				For gods and men alike. I taught myself

				 				This art; some god has breathed into my mind

				 				Songs of all kinds, and I could sing to thee

				 				As to a god. O, seek not then to take

				 				My life! Thy own dear son Telemachus

				 				Will bear me witness that not willingly

				 				Nor for the sake of lucre did I come

				 				To sing before the suitors at their feasts

				 				And in thy palace, but was forced to come

				 				By numbers and by mightier men than I.”



			 				He ceased; Telemachus, the mighty, heard

				 				And thus bespake his father at his side:﻿—



			 				“Refrain; smite not the guiltless with the sword;

				 				And be the herald, Medon, also spared,

				 				Who in our palace had the care of me

				 				Through all my childhood; if he be not slain

				 				Already by Philoetius, or by him

				 				Who tends the swine, or if he have not met

				 				Thyself, when thou wert ranging through the hail.”



			 				He spake, and the sagacious Medon heard,

				 				As crouching underneath a throne he lay,

				 				Wrapped in the skin just taken from a steer,

				 				To hide from the black doom of death. He came

				 				From where he lay, and quickly flung aside

				 				The skin, and, springing forward, clasped the knees

				 				Of the young prince, and said in winged words:﻿—



			 				“Dear youth, behold me here; be merciful;

				 				Speak to thy father, that he put not forth

				 				His sword to slay me, eager as he is

				 				For vengeance, and incensed against the men

				 				Who haunt these halls to make his wealth a spoil,

				 				And in their folly hold thyself in scorn.”



			 				He spake; the sage Ulysses smiled and said:

				 				“Be of good cheer, since this my son protects

				 				And rescues thee. Now mayst thou well perceive,

				 				And say to other men, how much more safe

				 				Is doing good than evil. Go thou forth

				 				Out of this slaughter to the open court,

				 				Thou and the illustrious bard, and sit ye there,

				 				While here within I do what yet I must.”



			 				He spake; they moved away and left the hall,

				 				And by the altar of almighty Jove

				 				Sat looking round them, still in fear of death.



			 				Meantime, Ulysses passed with searching look

				 				O’er all the place, to find if yet remained

				 				A single one of all the suitor-crew

				 				Alive, and skulking from his bitter doom.

				 				He saw that all had fallen in blood and dust,

				 				Many as fishes on the shelving beach

				 				Drawn from the hoary deep by those who tend

				 				The nets with myriad meshes. Poured abroad

				 				Upon the sand, while panting to return

				 				To the salt sea they lie, till the hot sun

				 				Takes their life from them; so the suitors lay

				 				Heaped on each other. Then Ulysses took

				 				The word, and thus bespake Telemachus:﻿—



			 				“Go now, Telemachus, and hither call

				 				The nurse, Dame Eurycleia. I would say

				 				Somewhat to her that comes into my thought.”



			 				So spake the chief. Telemachus obeyed

				 				The word, and smote the door, and called the nurse:﻿—



			 				“Come hither, ancient dame, who hast in charge

				 				To oversee the women in their tasks;

				 				My father calls thee, and would speak with thee.”



			 				He spake; nor flew the word in vain; she flung

				 				Apart the portals of those stately rooms,

				 				And came in haste. Before her went the prince.

				 				Among the corpses of the slain they found

				 				Ulysses, stained with blood, and grimed with dust.

				 				As when a lion, who has just devoured

				 				A bullock of the pasture, moves away,

				 				A terror to the sight, with breast and cheeks

				 				All bathed in blood; so did Ulysses seem,

				 				His feet and hands steeped in the blood of men.

				 				She, when she saw the corpses and the pools

				 				Of blood, and knew the mighty task complete,

				 				Was moved to shout for joy. Ulysses checked

				 				Her eager zeal, and said in winged words:﻿—



			 				“Rejoice in spirit, dame, but calm thyself,

				 				And shout not. To exult aloud o’er those

				 				Who lie in death is an unholy thing.

				 				The pleasure of the gods, and their own guilt,

				 				Brought death on these; for no respect had they

				 				To any of their fellow-men﻿—the good

				 				Or evil﻿—whosoever he might be

				 				That came to them, and thus on their own heads

				 				They drew this fearful fate. Now name to me

				 				The women of the palace; let me know

				 				Who is disloyal, and who innocent.”



			 				Then thus the well-beloved nurse replied:

				 				“My son, I will declare the truth. There dwell

				 				Here in thy palace fifty serving-maids,

				 				Whom we have taught to work, to comb the fleece

				 				And serve the household. Twelve of these have walked

				 				The way of shame. To me they give no heed,

				 				Nor to Penelope herself. Thy son

				 				Has just now grown to manhood, and the queen

				 				Has never suffered him to rule the maids;

				 				But let me now, ascending to her room﻿—

				 				The royal bower﻿—apprise thy wife, to whom

				 				Some deity has sent the gift of sleep.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:

				 				“Wake her not yet, but go and summon all

				 				The women who have wrought these shameful deeds.”



			 				He spake; the matron through the palace went

				 				To seek the women, and to bid them come.

				 				Meanwhile, Ulysses called Telemachus,

				 				The herdsman and the swineherd to his side,

				 				And thus commanded them with wingea words:﻿—



			 				“Begin to carry forth the dead, and call

				 				The women to your aid; and next make clean,

				 				With water and with thirsty sponges, all

				 				The sumptuous thrones and tables. When ye thus

				 				Have put the hall in order, lead away

				 				The serving-maids, and in the space between

				 				The kitchen vault and solid outer wall

				 				Smite them with your long swords till they give up

				 				The ghost, and lose the memory evermore

				 				Of secret meetings with the suitor-train.”



			 				He spake; the women came, lamenting loud

				 				With many tears, and carried forth the dead,

				 				Leaning upon each other as they went,

				 				And placed them underneath the portico

				 				Of the walled court. Ulysses gave command,

				 				Hastening their task, as all unwillingly

				 				They bore the corpses forth. With water next,

				 				And thirsty sponges in their hands, they cleansed

				 				The sumptuous thrones and tables. Then the prince,

				 				Telemachus, with shovels cleared the floor,

				 				The herdsman and the swineherd aiding him,

				 				And made the women bear the rubbish forth.

				 				And now when all within was once again

				 				In seemly order, they led forth the maids

				 				From that fair pile into the space between

				 				The kitchen vault and solid outer wall,

				 				A narrow space from which was no escape,

				 				And thus discreet Telemachus began:﻿—



			 				“I will not take away these creatures’ lives

				 				By a pure death﻿—these who so long have heaped

				 				Reproaches on my mother’s head and mine,

				 				And played the wanton with the suitor-crew.”



			 				He spake, and made the hawser of a ship

				 				Fast to a lofty shaft; the other end

				 				He wound about the kitchen vault. So high

				 				He stretched it that the feet of none who hung

				 				On it might touch the ground. As when a flock

				 				Of broad-winged thrushes or wild pigeons strike

				 				A net within a thicket, as they seek

				 				Their perch, and find unwelcome durance there,

				 				So hung the women, with their heads a-row,

				 				And cords about their necks, that they might die

				 				A miserable death. A little while,

				 				And but a little, quivered their loose feet

				 				In air. They led Melanthius from the hall

				 				And through the porch, cut off his nose and ears,

				 				Wrenched out the parts of shame, a bloody meal

				 				For dogs, and in their anger from the trunk

				 				Lopped hands and feet. Then having duly washed

				 				Their feet and hands, they came into the hall,

				 				And to Ulysses; they had done their work.

				 				And then to the dear nurse Ulysses said:﻿—



			 				“Bring sulphur, dame, the cure of noxious air,

				 				And fire, that I may purge the hall with smoke;

				 				And go, and bid Penelope come down,

				 				With her attendant women, and command

				 				That all the handmaids of the household come.”



			 				And thus in turn Dame Eurycleia spake:

				 				“Well hast thou said, my son, but suffer me

				 				To bring thee clothes, a tunic and a cloak,

				 				Nor with those rags on thy broad shoulders stand

				 				In thine own palace; it becomes thee not.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:

				 				“First let a fire be kindled in this hall.”



			 				He spake, and Eurycleia, the dear nurse,

				 				Obeyed, and brought the sulphur and the fire.

				 				Ulysses steeped in smoke the royal pile.

				 				Both hall and court. The matron, passing through

				 				The stately palace of Ulysses, climbed

				 				The stair to find and summon all the maids.

				 				And forth they issued, bearing in their hands

				 				Torches, and, crowding round Ulysses, gave

				 				Glad greeting, seized his hands, embraced him, kissed

				 				His hands and brow and shoulders. The desire

				 				To weep for joy o’ercame the chief; his eyes

				 				O’erflowed with tears; he sobbed; he knew them all.





						Book 						XXIII


					Ulysses and Penelope After the Slaughter


				 				Descent of Penelope to the hall﻿—Her doubts of the identity of Ulysses removed by evident tokens given by Ulysses﻿—Her transport at their removal﻿—His narrative of his adventures﻿—Departure of Ulysses with his son, the herdsman, and the swineherd, to the country.





				Up to the royal bower the matron went

				 				With an exulting heart, to tell the queen

				 				That her beloved husband was within.

				 				With knees that faltered not, and quick light step

				 				She went, and, standing by her mistress, said:﻿—



			 				“Awake, Penelope, dear child, and see

				 				With thine own eyes what thou hast pined for long.

				 				Ulysses has returned; thy lord is here,

				 				Though late, and he has slain the arrogant crew

				 				Of suitors, who disgraced his house, and made

				 				His wealth a spoil, and dared insult his son.”



			 				And thus discreet Penelope replied:

				 				“The gods, dear nurse, have made thee mad; for they

				 				Have power to change the wisest men to fools,

				 				And make the foolish wise, and they have warped

				 				Thy mind once sound. How canst thou mock me thus,

				 				Amidst my sorrows, with such idle tales?

				 				Why wake me from the pleasant sleep that closed

				 				My lids so softly? Never have I slept

				 				So sweetly since Ulysses went from me

				 				To that bad city, which no tongue should name.

				 				Go, then; return into the lower rooms.

				 				Had any of my women save thyself

				 				Brought such a message to disturb my sleep,

				 				I would have sent her back into the hall

				 				With angry words; thy years are thy excuse.”



			 				But Eurycleia, the dear nurse, rejoined:

				 				“Nay, my dear child, I mock thee not. Most true

				 				It is that thy Ulysses has returned,

				 				And here he is at home, as I have said.

				 				The stranger whom they scoffed at in the hall

				 				Is he; and long Telemachus has known

				 				That he was here, but wisely kept from all

				 				His father’s secret, till he should avenge

				 				Upon those violent men their guilty deeds.”



			 				She ended, and her mistress, overjoyed,

				 				Sprang from her couch, embraced the aged dame,

				 				And wept, and said to her in winged words:﻿—



			 				“Tell me, dear nurse, and truly, if indeed

				 				Ulysses have returned as thou hast said.

				 				How smote he those proud suitors?﻿—he alone,

				 				And they so many, gathered in the hall.”



			 				And thus the well-beloved nurse replied:

				 				“I saw it not, nor knew of it. I heard

				 				Only the moanings of the slain, while we

				 				The maids, affrighted, sat in a recess

				 				Of that well-vaulted chamber; the firm doors

				 				Closed us all in, until at length thy son,

				 				Sent by his father, called me forth. I found

				 				Ulysses standing midst the dead that lay

				 				Heaped on each other, everywhere along

				 				The solid pavement. Thou wouldst have rejoiced

				 				To see him like a lion with the stains

				 				Of slaughter on him. Now the suitors lie

				 				Before the portals of the palace-court,

				 				And he has kindled a great fire, and steeps

				 				In smoke the noble hall. He bade me come

				 				To call thee. Follow me, that ye may give

				 				Your hearts to gladness﻿—for ye have endured

				 				Great sorrows both, and your long-cherished hope

				 				Is now fulfilled. He hath returned alive

				 				To his dear home, and finds thee and his son

				 				Yet in his palace, and hath terribly

				 				Avenged himself upon the guilty men

				 				Who under his own roof have done him wrong.”



			 				Then spake the sage Penelope again:

				 				“Beloved nurse, exult not overmuch,

				 				Nor rashly boast. Well is it known to thee,

				 				Were he to come beneath this roof again,

				 				How welcome he would be to all, but most

				 				To me and to the son to whom we gave

				 				His being. Yet thy tidings are not true.

				 				Someone of the immortals must have slain

				 				The arrogant suitors, angry to behold

				 				Their foul injustice and their many crimes;

				 				For no respect had they to mortal man,

				 				Good he might be, or bad, whome’er they met;

				 				And therefore have they made an evil end.

				 				But my Ulysses must have perished far

				 				From Ithaca, cut off from his return.”



			 				Then Eurycleia, the dear nurse, rejoined:

				 				“What words are these, my child, that pass thy lips?

				 				Sayst thou, then, that thy husband, who now stands

				 				Upon thy hearthstone, never will return?

				 				O slow of faith! but thou wert ever thus.

				 				Come, then, I give a certain proof. I saw

				 				Myself, when he was at the bath, the scar

				 				Left on him by the white tusk of a boar,

				 				And would have told thee, but he laid his hands

				 				Upon my mouth, and would not suffer me

				 				To bear the tidings, such his forecast was.

				 				Now follow me; I give my life in pledge.

				 				If I deceive thee, slay me ruthlessly.”



			 				Then spake discreet Penelope again:

				 				“Dear nurse, though thou in many things art wise,

				 				Think not to scan the counsels of the gods,

				 				Who live forever. Yet will we descend,

				 				And meet my son, and look upon the slain,

				 				And see the avenger by whose hand they fell.”



			 				She spake, and from the royal bower went down,

				 				Uncertain whether she should stand aloof

				 				And question there her lord, or haste to him

				 				And clasp his hands in hers and kiss his brow.

				 				But having passed the threshold of hewn stone,

				 				Entering she took her seat right opposite

				 				Ulysses, in the full glow of the fire,

				 				Against the other wall. Ulysses sat

				 				Beside a lofty column with his eyes

				 				Cast down, and waiting for his highborn wife

				 				To speak when she had seen him. Long she sat

				 				In silence, for amazement overpowered

				 				Her senses. Sometimes, looking in his eyes,

				 				She saw her husband there, and then again,

				 				Clad in those sordid weeds, she knew him not.

				 				Then spake Telemachus, and chid her thus:﻿—



			 				“Mother, unfeeling mother! hard of heart

				 				Art thou; how else couldst thou remain aloof?

				 				How keep from taking, at my father’s side,

				 				Thy place, to talk with him, and question him?

				 				No other wife could bring herself to bear

				 				Such distance from a husband, just returned

				 				After long hardships, in the twentieth year

				 				Of absence, to his native land and her.

				 				Mother! thy heart is harder than a stone.”



			 				And thus the sage Penelope replied:

				 				“Dear child, my faculties are overpowered

				 				With wonder, and I cannot question him,

				 				Nor even speak to him, nor fix my looks

				 				Upon his face. But if it be indeed

				 				Ulysses, and he have returned, we soon

				 				Shall know each other; there are tokens known

				 				To both of us, to none but him and me.”



			 				She ended, and the much-enduring chief

				 				Ulysses, smiling at her words, bespake

				 				Telemachus at once, in winged words:﻿—



			 				“Suffer thy mother, O Telemachus,

				 				To prove me; she will know me better soon.

				 				My looks are sordid, and my limbs are wrapped

				 				In tattered raiment, therefore does she think

				 				Meanly of me, and cannot willingly

				 				Believe that I am he. But let us now

				 				Consider what most wisely may be done.

				 				He who hath slain, among a tribe of men,

				 				A single one with few to avenge his death,

				 				Flees from his kindred and his native land;

				 				But we have slain the champions of the realm,

				 				The flower of all the youth of Ithaca.

				 				Therefore, I pray thee, think what shall be done.”



			 				And then disoreet Telemachus replied:

				 				“Look thou to that, dear father; for they say

				 				That thou of all mankind wert wont to give

				 				The wisest counsels. None of mortal birth

				 				In this was deemed thy peer. We follow thee

				 				With cheerful hearts; nor will our courage fail,

				 				I think, in aught that lies within our power.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:

				 				“Then will I tell thee what I deem most wise.

				 				First take the bath, and then array yourselves

				 				In tunics, bid the palace-maidens choose

				 				Fresh garments; let the godlike bard, who bears

				 				The clear-toned harp, be leader, and strike up

				 				A melody to prompt the festive dance,

				 				That all may say who hear it from without﻿—

				 				Whether the passers by or dwellers near﻿—

				 				‘It is a wedding.’ Else throughout the land

				 				The rumor of the slaughter we have wrought

				 				Among the suitors may have spread before

				 				We reach our wooded farm, and there consult

				 				Beneath the guidance of Olympian Jove.”



			 				He spake; they hearkened and obeyed. They took

				 				The bath, and then they put their garments on.

				 				The maids arrayed themselves; the godlike bard

				 				Took the curved harp, and woke in all the love

				 				Of melody, and of the graceful dance.

				 				The spacious pile resounded to the steps

				 				Of men and shapely women in their mirth,

				 				And one who stood without was heard to say:﻿—



			 				“Someone, no doubt, has made the long-wooed queen

				 				His bride at last; a worthless woman she,

				 				Who could not, for the husband of her youth,

				 				Keep his fair palace till he came again.”



			 				Such words were said, but they who uttered them

				 				Knew little what had passed. Eurynomè,

				 				The matron of the palace, meantime took

				 				Magnanimous Ulysses to the bath

				 				In his own dwelling, smoothed his limbs with oil,

				 				And threw a gorgeous mantle over him

				 				And tunic. Pallas on the hero’s head

				 				Shed grace and majesty; she made him seem

				 				Taller and statelier, made his locks flow down

				 				In curls like blossoms of the hyacinth,

				 				As when a workman skilled in many arts,

				 				And taught by Pallas and Minerva, twines

				 				A golden border round the silver mass,

				 				A glorious work; so did the goddess shed

				 				Grace o’er his face and form. So from the bath

				 				He stepped, like one of the immortals, took

				 				The seat from which he rose, right opposite

				 				Penelope, and thus addressed the queen:﻿—



			 				“Lady, the dwellers of the Olympian heights

				 				Have given thee an impenetrable heart

				 				Beyond all other women. Sure I am

				 				No other wife could bring herself to bear

				 				Such distance from a husband just returned

				 				After long hardships, in the twentieth year

				 				Of absence, to his native land and her.

				 				Come, nurse, prepare a bed, where by myself

				 				I may lie down; an iron heart is hers.”



			 				To this the sage Penelope replied:

				 				“Nay, sir, ’tis not through pride or disregard,

				 				Or through excess of wonder, that I act

				 				Thus toward thee. Well do I remember thee

				 				As thou wert in the day when thy good ship

				 				Bore thee from Ithaca. Bestir thyself,

				 				Dame Eurycleia, and make up with care

				 				A bed without the chamber, which he framed

				 				With his own hands; bear out the massive bed,

				 				And lay upon it seemly coverings,

				 				Fleeces and mantles for his nightly rest.”



			 				She spake to try her husband; but, displeased,

				 				Ulysses answered thus his virtuous queen:﻿—



			 				“O woman, thou hast said unwelcome words.

				 				Who hath displaced my bed? That task were hard

				 				For long-experienced hands, unless some god

				 				Had come to shift its place. No living man,

				 				Even in his prime of years, could easily

				 				Have moved it, for in that elaborate work

				 				There was a mystery; it was I myself

				 				Who shaped it, no one else. Within my court

				 				There grew an olive-tree with full-leaved boughs,

				 				A tall and flourishing tree; its massive stem

				 				Was like a column. Round it I built up

				 				A chamber with cemented stones until

				 				The walls were finished; then I framed a roof

				 				Above it, and put on the well-glued doors

				 				Close fitting. Next I lopped the full-leaved boughs,

				 				And, cutting off the trunk above the root,

				 				Smoothed well the stump with tools, and made of it

				 				A post to bear the couch. I bored the wood

				 				With wimbles, placed on it the frame, and carved

				 				The work till it was done, inlaying it

				 				With silver, gold, and ivory. I stretched

				 				Upon it thongs of oxhide brightly dyed

				 				In purple. Now, O wife, I cannot know

				 				Whether my bed remains as then it was,

				 				Or whether someone from the root has hewn

				 				The olive trunk, and moved it from its place.”



			 				He spake, and her knees faltered and her heart

				 				Was melted as she heard her lord recount

				 				The tokens all so truly; and she wept,

				 				And rose, and ran to him, and flung her arms

				 				About his neck, and kissed his brow, and said:﻿—



			 				“Ulysses, look not on me angrily,

				 				Thou who in other things art wise above

				 				All other men. The gods have made our lot

				 				A hard one, jealous lest we should have passed

				 				Our youth together happily, and thus

				 				Have reached old age. I pray, be not incensed,

				 				Nor take it ill that I embraced thee not

				 				As soon as I beheld thee, for my heart

				 				Has ever trembled lest someone who comes

				 				Into this isle should cozen me with words;

				 				And they who practise fraud are numberless.

				 				The Argive Helen, child of Jupiter,

				 				Would ne’er have listened to a stranger’s suit

				 				And loved him, had she known that in the years

				 				To come the warlike Greeks would bring her back

				 				To her own land. It was a deity

				 				Who prompted her to that foul wrong. Her thought

				 				Was never of the great calamity

				 				Which followed, and which brought such woe on us.

				 				But now, since thou, by tokens clear and true,

				 				Hast spoken of our bed, which human eye

				 				Has never seen save mine and thine, and those

				 				Of one handmaiden only, Actoris﻿—

				 				Her whom my father gave me when I came

				 				To this thy palace, and who kept the door

				 				Of our close chamber﻿—thou hast won my mind

				 				To full belief, though hard it was to win.”



			 				She spake, and he was moved to tears; he wept

				 				As in his arms he held his dearly loved

				 				And faithful wife. As welcome as the land

				 				To those who swim the deep, of whose stout barque

				 				Neptune has made a wreck amidst the waves,

				 				Tossed by the billow and the blast, and few

				 				Are those who from the hoary ocean reach

				 				The shore, their limbs all crested with the brine,

				 				These gladly climb the sea-beach, and are safe﻿—

				 				So welcome was her husband to her eyes.

				 				Nor would her fair white arms release his neck,

				 				And there would rosy-fingered Morn have found

				 				Both weeping, but the blue-eyed Pallas planned

				 				That thus it should not be; she stayed the night

				 				When near its close, and held the golden Morn

				 				Long in the ocean deeps, nor suffered her

				 				To yoke her steeds that bring the light to men﻿—

				 				Lampas and Phaëthon, swift steeds that bear

				 				The Morning on her way. Ulysses then,

				 				The man of forecast, thus bespake his queen:﻿—



			 				“Not yet, O wife, have we attained the close

				 				Of all our labors. One remains which yet

				 				I must achieve, toilsome, and measureless

				 				In difficulty; for so prophesied

				 				The spirit of Tiresias, on the day

				 				When to the abode of Pluto I went down

				 				To ask the seer concerning the return

				 				Of my companions, and my own. But now

				 				Seek we our couch, dear wife, that, softly laid,

				 				We may refresh ourselves with welcome sleep.”



			 				Then spake in turn the sage Penelope:

				 				“Whenever thou desirest it thy couch

				 				Shall be made ready, since the gods vouchsafe

				 				To bring thee back into thy pleasant home

				 				And to thy native land. But now that thou

				 				Hast spoken of it, and some deity

				 				Is prompting thee, declare what this new task

				 				May be. Hereafter I shall hear of it,

				 				No doubt, nor were it worse to know it now.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:

				 				“Dear wife, why wilt thou ask? why press me thus?

				 				Yet will I tell thee truly, nor will keep

				 				Aught from thee, though thou wilt not gladly hear,

				 				Nor I relate. Tiresias bade me pass

				 				Through city after city, till I found

				 				A people who know not the sea, nor eat

				 				Their food with salt, who never yet beheld

				 				The red-prowed galley, nor the shapely oars,

				 				Which are the wings of ships. And this plain sign

				 				He gave, nor will I keep it back from thee,

				 				That when another traveller whom I meet

				 				Shall say it is a winnowing-fan I bear

				 				On my stout shoulder, there he bade me plant

				 				The oar upright in earth, and offer up

				 				To monarch Neptune there a ram, a bull,

				 				And sturdy boar, and then, returning home,

				 				Burn hallowed hecatombs to all the gods

				 				Who dwell in the broad heaven, each one in turn.

				 				At last will death come over me, afar

				 				From ocean, such a death as peacefully

				 				Shall take me off in a serene old age,

				 				Amid a people prosperous and content

				 				All this, the prophet said, will come to pass.”



			 				And then the sage Penelope rejoined:

				 				“If thus the immortals make thy later age

				 				The happier, there is hope that thou wilt find

				 				Escape from evil in the years to come.”



			 				So talked they with each other. Meantime went

				 				Eurynomè, attended by the nurse,

				 				And in the light of blazing torches dressed

				 				With soft fresh drapery a bed; and when

				 				Their busy hands had made it full and high,

				 				The aged dame withdrew to take her rest

				 				In her own chamber, while Eurynomè,

				 				Who kept the royal bower, upheld a torch

				 				And thither led the pair, and, when they both

				 				Were in the chamber, went her way. They took

				 				Their place delighted in the ancient bed.

				 				The prince, the herdsman, and the swineherd ceased

				 				Meantime to tread the dance, and bade the maids

				 				Cease also, and within the palace-rooms

				 				Dark with night’s shadow, sought their place of rest.

				 				Then came the time of pleasant mutual talk,

				 				In which that noblest among women spake

				 				Of wrongs endured beneath her roof from those

				 				Who came to woo her﻿—an insatiate crew﻿—

				 				Who made of beeves and fatlings of the flock

				 				Large slaughter, and drained many a wine-cask dry.

				 				Then nobly born Ulysses told what woes

				 				His valor brought on other men; what toils

				 				And suffering he had borne; he told her all,

				 				And she, delighted, heard him, nor did sleep

				 				Light on her eyelids till his tale was done.



			 				And first he told her how he overcame

				 				The people of Ciconia; how he passed

				 				Thence to the rich fields of the race who feed

				 				Upon the lotus; what the Cyclops did,

				 				And how upon the Cyclops he avenged

				 				The death of his brave comrades, whom the wretch

				 				Had piteously slaughtered and devoured.

				 				And how he came to Aeolus, and found

				 				A friendly welcome, and was sent by him

				 				Upon his voyage; yet ’twas not his fate

				 				To reach his native land; a tempest caught

				 				His fleet, and far across the fishy deep

				 				Bore him away, lamenting bitterly.

				 				And how he landed at Telepylus,

				 				Among the Laestrigonians, who destroyed

				 				His ships and warlike comrades, he alone

				 				In his black ship escaping. Then he told

				 				Of Circè, her deceit and many arts,

				 				And how he went to Pluto’s dismal realm

				 				In his good galley, to consult the soul

				 				Of him of Thebes, Tiresias, and beheld

				 				All his lost comrades and his mother﻿—her

				 				Who brought him forth, and trained him when a child.

				 				And how he heard the Sirens afterward,

				 				And how he came upon the wandering rocks,

				 				The terrible Charybdis, and the crags

				 				Of Scylla﻿—which no man had ever passed

				 				In safety; how his comrades slew for food

				 				The oxen of the Sun; how Jupiter,

				 				The Thunderer, with a bolt of fire from heaven

				 				Smote his swift barque; and how his gallant crew

				 				All perished, he alone escaped with life.

				 				And how he reached Ogygia’s isle, he told,

				 				And met the nymph Calypso, who desired

				 				That he would be her husband, and long time

				 				Detained and fed him in her vaulted grot,

				 				And promised that he ne’er should die, nor know

				 				Decay of age, through all the days to come;

				 				Yet moved she not the purpose of his heart.

				 				And how he next through many hardships came

				 				To the Phaeacians, and they welcomed him

				 				And honored him as if he were a god,

				 				And to his native country in a barque

				 				Sent him with ample gifts of brass and gold

				 				And raiment. As he uttered this last word,

				 				Sleep softly overcame him; all his limbs

				 				Lay loose in rest, and all his cares were calmed.



			 				The blue-eyed Pallas had yet new designs;

				 				And when she deemed Ulysses was refreshed

				 				With rest and sleep, in that accustomed bed,

				 				She called the Morning, daughter of the Dawn,

				 				To rise from ocean in her car of gold,

				 				And shed her light on men. Ulysses rose

				 				From his soft couch, and thus enjoined his spouse:﻿—



			 				“O wife! enough of misery have we borne

				 				Already﻿—thou in weeping for my long

				 				Unhappy absence﻿—I for years withheld

				 				By Jupiter and all the other gods

				 				From my return to this dear land, although

				 				I pined for home. Now since upon this couch

				 				We take the place so earnestly desired,

				 				Take thou the charge of all that I possess

				 				Here in the palace. For the herds and flocks

				 				Which those high-handed suitors have devoured,

				 				I shall seize many others as a spoil;

				 				The rest the Greeks will bring me, till my stalls

				 				Are filled again. I hasten to my farm

				 				Embowered in trees, to greet the aged man

				 				My excellent father, who continually

				 				Grieves for me. Prudent as thou art, I give

				 				This charge; a rumor, with the rising sun,

				 				Will quickly go abroad that I have slain

				 				The suitors in the palace. Now withdraw,

				 				Thou and thy maidens, to the upper room,

				 				And sit and look not forth, nor ask of aught.”



			 				So spake the chief, and on his shoulders braced

				 				His glorious armor. Then he called his son,

				 				The herdsman, and the swineherd, bidding them

				 				To take in hand their weapons. They obeyed,

				 				And, having armed themselves in brass, they threw

				 				The portals open. As they all went forth,

				 				Ulysses led the way. The early light

				 				Was on the earth, but Pallas, shrouding them

				 				In darkness, led them quickly through the town.

				Cyllenian Hermes summoned forth the souls

				 				Of the slain suitors. In his hand he bore

				 				The beautiful golden wand, with which at will

				 				He shuts the eyes of men, or opens them

				 				From sleep. With this he guided on their way

				 				The ghostly rout; they followed, uttering

				 				A shrilly wail. As when a flock of bats,

				 				Deep in a dismal cavern, fly about

				 				And squeak, if one have fallen from the place

				 				Where, clinging to each other and the rock,

				 				They rested, so that crowd of ghosts went forth

				 				With shrill and plaintive cries. Before them moved

				 				Beneficent Hermes through those dreary ways,

				 				And past the ocean stream they went, and past

				 				Leucadia’s rock, the portals of the Sun,

				 				And people of the land of dreams, until

				 				They reached the fields of asphodel, where dwell

				 				The souls, the bodiless forms of those who die.



			 				And there they found the soul of Peleus’ son,

				 				His friend Patroclus, and the blameless chief

				 				Antilochus, and Ajax, who excelled

				 				In stature and in form all other Greeks

				 				Save the great son of Peleus. These were grouped

				 				Around Achilles. Then approached the ghost

				 				Of Agamemnon, Atreus’ son; he seemed

				 				In sorrow, and around him others stood,

				 				Who in the palace of Aegisthus met

				 				Their fate and died. The son of Peleus took

				 				The word, and spake to Agamemnon thus:﻿—



			 				“Atrides, we had thought that Jove, who wields

				 				The thunder, favored thee, through all thy years,

				 				Beyond all other men﻿—thou didst bear rule

				 				Over so many and such valiant men

				 				Upon the plain of Troy, where we of Greece

				 				Endured such sufferings. Yet all too soon

				 				The cruel doom of death, which no man born

				 				Of woman can escape, has fallen on thee.

				 				O, if amid the honors of thy sway

				 				That doom had overtaken thee, while yet

				 				In Troy’s far realm, then would the assembled Greeks

				 				Have built a tomb to thee! Thou wouldst have left

				 				A heritage of glory to thy son;

				 				Now hast thou died a most unhappy death.”



			 				And then the soul of Agamemnon said:

				 				“Fortunate son of Peleus, godlike chief

				 				Achilles, who didst die upon the field

				 				Of Ilium, far from Argos, while there fell

				 				Around thee many of the bravest sons

				 				Of Troy and Greece, who fought for thee, and thou

				 				Wert lying in thy mighty bulk, amid

				 				Whirlwinds of dust, forgetful evermore

				 				Of horsemanship. All that day long we fought,

				 				Nor stayed our hands till Jove, to part us, sent

				 				A hurricane. When we had borne thee thence

				 				And brought thee to the fleet, upon a bier

				 				We laid thee, pouring o’er thy shapely limbs

				 				Warm water, and anointing them with oil.

				 				Round thee the Achaians stood in tears, hot tears,

				 				And cut their hair away. From ocean’s depth

				 				Thy mother, when she heard the tidings, rose

				 				With her immortal sea-nymphs. Mournfully

				 				Came o’er the waves the sound of their lament.

				 				Trembled the Greeks with fear, and, rushing forth,

				 				Would have sought refuge in their roomy ships,

				 				If Nestor, wise in ancient lore, and known

				 				For counsels ever safe, had not restrained

				 				Their haste, and thus declared his prudent thought:﻿—



			 				“ ‘Stay, Argives, youths of Greece; think not of flight!

				 				It is his mother; from the sea she comes

				 				To her dead son, and brings her deathless nymphs.’



			 				“He spake; his words withheld the valiant Greeks

				 				From flight. And now around thee came and stood

				 				The daughters of the Ancient of the Deep,

				 				Lamenting bitterly. Upon thy corse

				 				They put ambrosial robes. The Muses nine

				 				Bewailed thee with sweet voices, answering

				 				Each other. Then wouldst thou have seen no one

				 				Of all the Argive host with eyes unwet,

				 				The Muses’ song so moved them. Seventeen day?

				 				And nights we mourned thee﻿—both the immortal ones

				 				And mortals. On the eighteenth day we gave

				 				Thy body to the fire, and at the pile

				 				Slew many fatling ewes, and many an ox

				 				With crooked horns. In raiment of the gods

				 				The fire consumed thee midst anointing oils

				 				And honey. Many heroes of our host

				 				In armor and in chariots, or on foot,

				 				Contended round thy funeral pyre in games,

				 				And mighty was the din. And when at length

				 				The fires of Vulcan had consumed thy flesh,

				 				We gathered up at morning thy white bones,

				 				Achilles, pouring over them pure wine

				 				And fragrant oils. Thy mother brought a vase

				 				Of gold, which Bacchus gave, she said, the work

				 				Of Vulcan the renowned, and in it now,

				 				Illustrious son of Peleus, thy white bones

				 				Are lying, and with thine are mingled those

				 				Of dead Patroclus Menoetiades.

				 				Apart we placed the ashes of thy friend

				 				Antilochus, whom thou didst honor most

				 				After the slain Patroclus. O’er all these

				 				The sacred army of the warlike Greeks

				 				Built up a tomb magnificently vast

				 				Upon a cape of the broad Hellespont,

				 				There to be seen, far off upon the deep,

				 				By those who now are born, or shall be born

				 				In future years. Thy mother, having first

				 				Prayed to the gods, appointed noble games,

				 				Within the circus, for the Achaian chiefs.

				 				Full often have I seen the funeral rites

				 				Of heroes, when the youth, their chieftain dead,

				 				Were girded for the games, and strove to win

				 				The prizes; but I most of all admired

				 				Those which the silver-footed Thetis gave

				 				To mark thy burial, who wert loved by all

				 				The immortals. So thou hast not lost by death

				 				Thy fame, Achilles, and among the tribes

				 				Of men thy glory will be ever great;

				 				But what hath it availed me to have brought

				 				The war on Ilium to an end, since Jove

				 				Doomed me to be destroyed on my return,

				 				Slain by Aegisthus and my guilty wife?”



			 				So talked they with each other. Now approached

				 				The herald Argus-queller, bringing down

				 				The souls of suitors by Ulysses slain.

				 				Both chiefs moved toward them, wondering at the sight.

				 				The soul of Agamemnon, Atreus’ son,

				 				Knew well-renowned Amphimedon, whose birth

				 				Was from Melanthius, and by whom he once

				 				Was welcomed to his house in Ithaca;

				 				And him the son of Atreus first bespake:﻿—



			 				“Amphimedon, what sad mischance has brought

				 				You all, who seem like chosen men, and all

				 				Of equal age, into these drear abodes

				 				Beneath the earth? ’Twere hard indeed to find,

				 				In a whole city, nobler forms of men.

				 				Has Neptune wrecked you in your ships at sea

				 				With fierce winds and huge waves, or armed men

				 				Smitten you on the land, while carrying off

				 				Their beeves and sheep, or fighting to defend

				 				Your wives and city? Tell me, for I claim

				 				To have been once your guest. Rememberest thou

				 				I lodged in thy own palace when I came

				 				With godlike Menelaus, and besought

				 				Ulysses to unite his gallant fleet

				 				To ours, and sail for Troy. A whole month long

				 				Were we in crossing the wide sea, and hard

				 				We found the task to gain as our ally

				 				Ulysses, the destroyer of walled towns.”



			 				The soul of dead Amphimedon replied:

				 				“Atrides Agamemnon, far renowned,

				 				And king of men, I well remember all

				 				Of which thou speakest; I will now relate,

				 				And truly, how we met our evil end.

				 				We wooed the wife of the long-absent chief

				 				Ulysses; she rejected not nor yet

				 				Granted our suit, detested as it was,

				 				But, meditating our destruction, planned

				 				This shrewd device. She laid upon the loom

				 				Within her rooms a web of delicate threads,

				 				Ample in length and breadth, and thus she said

				 				To all of us: ‘Young princes, who are come

				 				To woo me﻿—since Ulysses is no more,

				 				My noble husband﻿—urge me not, I pray,

				 				To marriage, till I finish in the loom﻿—

				 				That so my threads may not be spun in vain﻿—

				 				A funeral vesture for the hero-chief

				 				Laertes, when his fatal hour shall come,

				 				With death’s long sleep; else some Achaian dame

				 				Might blame me, should I leave without a shroud

				 				Him who in life possessed such ample wealth.’

				 				Such were her words, and easily they won

				 				Upon our generous minds. So went she on

				 				Weaving that ample web, and every night

				 				Unravelled it by torchlight. Three full years

				 				She practised thus, and by the fraud deceived

				 				The Grecian youths; but when the hours had brought

				 				The fourth year round, a woman who knew all

				 				Revealed the mystery, and we ourselves

				 				Saw her unravelling the ample web.

				 				Thenceforth constrained, and with unwilling hands,

				 				She finished it. And when at length she showed

				 				The vesture she had woven, the broad web

				 				That she had bleached to brightness like the sun’s

				 				Or like the moon’s, some hostile deity

				 				Brought back Ulysses to a distant nook

				 				Of his own fields, and to his swineherd’s lodge.

				 				And thither also came in his black ship

				 				His son, returning from the sandy coast

				 				Of Pylos. Thence the twain, when they had planned

				 				To slay the suitors, came within the walls

				 				Of the great city; first Telemachus,

				 				And after him Ulysses, with his guide

				 				The swineherd. He was clad in sordid weeds,

				 				And seemed a wretched beggar, very old,

				 				Propped on a staff. In that disguise of rags

				 				None knew him, as he suddenly appeared,

				 				Not even the oldest of us all. Harsh words

				 				And blows we gave him. He endured them all

				 				Awhile with patience, smitten and reviled

				 				In his own palace. Moved at length by Jove,

				 				He and his son Telemachus bore off

				 				The shining weapons from the hall, to lie

				 				In a far chamber, and barred all the doors.

				 				Then, prompted by her husband’s craft, the queen

				 				Proposed a game of archery, with bow

				 				And rings of hoary steel, to all of us

				 				Ill-fated suitors. This drew on our death.

				 				Not one of us could bend that sturdy bow,

				 				None had the strength. But as it passed from us

				 				Into Ulysses’ hands, we loudly chid

				 				The bearer, and forbade him, but in vain.

				 				Telemachus alone with stern command

				 				Bade him deliver it. When in his hands

				 				The much-enduring chief, Ulysses, took

				 				The bow, he drew the string with ease, and sent

				 				A shaft through all the rings. He sprang and stood

				 				Upon the threshold; at his feet he poured

				 				The winged arrows, cast a terrible glance

				 				Around him, and laid King Antinoüs dead,

				 				Then sent the fatal shafts at those who stood

				 				Before him; side by side they fell and died.

				 				Some god, we saw, was with them, as they rushed

				 				Upon us mightily, and chased us through

				 				The palace, slaying us on every side;

				 				And fearful were the groans of dying men,

				 				As skulls were cloven, and the pavement swam

				 				With blood. Such, Agamemnon, was the fate

				 				By which we perished. Now our bodies lie

				 				Neglected at the palace; for not yet

				 				Our kindred, dwelling in our homes, have heard

				 				The tidings, nor have come to cleanse our wounds

				 				From the dark blood, and lay us on the bier

				 				With tears﻿—such honors as are due the dead.”



			 				In turn the soul of Agamemnon spake:

				 				“Son of Laertes, fortunate and wise,

				 				Ulysses! thou by feats of eminent might

				 				And valor dost possess thy wife again.

				 				And nobly minded is thy blameless queen,

				 				The daughter of Icarius, faithfully

				 				Remembering him to whom she gave her troth

				 				While yet a virgin. Never shall the fame

				 				Of his great valor perish, and the gods

				 				Themselves shall frame, for those who dwell on earth,

				 				Sweet strains in praise of sage Penelope.

				 				Not such was she who treacherously slew

				 				The husband of her youth﻿—she of the house

				 				Of Tyndarus. Her name among mankind

				 				Shall be the hateful burden of a song;

				 				And great is the dishonor it has brought

				 				On women, even the faithful and the good.”



			 				So talked they with each other, standing there

				 				In Pluto’s realm beneath the vaulted earth.

				 				Meantime Ulysses, hastening from the town,

				 				Came to the fair fields of Laertes, tilled

				 				With care. Laertes, after years of toil,

				 				Acquired them. There his dwelling stood; a shed

				 				Encircled it, where ate and sat and slept

				 				The servants of the household, who fulfilled

				 				His slightest wish. An old Sicilian dame

				 				Was there, who waited, in that distant spot,

				 				On her old master with assiduous care.

				 				And then Ulysses to his followers said:﻿—



			 				“Go into that fair dwelling, and with speed

				 				Slay for our feast the fattest of the swine.

				 				I go to prove my father; I would learn

				 				Whether he knows me when he sees my face,

				 				Or haply knows me not, so long away.”



			 				He spake, and laid his weapons in their hands.

				 				Straight toward the house they went. Ulysses passed

				 				Into the fruitful orchard, there to prove

				 				His father. Going down and far within

				 				The garden-plot, he found not Dolius there,

				 				Nor any of the servants, nor his sons.

				 				All were abroad, old Dolius leading them.

				 				They gathered thorns to fence the garden-grounds.

				 				There, delving in that fertile spot, around

				 				A newly planted tree, Ulysses saw

				 				His father only, sordidly arrayed

				 				In a coarse tunic, patched and soiled. He wore

				 				Patched greaves of bullock’s hide upon his thighs,

				 				A fence against the thorns; and on his hands

				 				gloves, to protect them from the prickly stems

				 				Of bramble; and upon his head a cap

				 				Of goatskin. There he brooded o’er his grief.

				 				Him when the much-enduring chief beheld,

				 				Wasted with age and sorrow-worn, he stopped

				 				Beside a lofty pear-tree’s stem and wept,

				 				And pondered whether he should kiss and clasp

				 				His father in his arms, and tell him all,

				 				How he had reached his native land and home,

				 				Or question first and prove him. Musing thus,

				 				It pleased him to begin with sportive words;

				 				And thus resolved, divine Ulysses drew

				 				Near to his father stooping at his task,

				 				And loosening the hard earth about a tree,

				 				And thus the illustrious son accosted him:﻿—



			 				“O aged man! there is no lack of skill

				 				In tending this fair orchard, which thy care

				 				Keeps flourishing; no growth is there of fig,

				 				Vine, pear, or olive, or of plants that grow

				 				In borders, that has missed thy friendly hand.

				 				Yet let me say, and be thou not displeased,

				 				Thou art ill cared for, burdened as thou art

				 				With years, and squalid, and in mean attire.

				 				It cannot be that for thy idleness

				 				Thy master treats thee thus; nor is there seen

				 				Aught servile in thy aspect﻿—in thy face

				 				Or stature; thou art rather like a king;

				 				Thou seemest one who should enjoy the bath

				 				And banquet, and lie soft﻿—for this befits

				 				Old men like thee. Now say, and tell me true,

				 				Who may thy master be? whose orchard this

				 				Which thou dost tend? And, more than this, declare,

				 				For much I long to know, if I am come

				 				To Ithaca, as I just now was told

				 				By one who met me as I came﻿—a man

				 				Not overwise, who would not stop to tell

				 				What I desired to learn, nor bear to hear

				 				My questions, when I asked him if a guest

				 				Of mine were living yet in health, or dead

				 				And in the realm of Pluto. Let me speak

				 				Of him, and mark me well, I pray; I lodged

				 				Once, in my native land, a man who came

				 				Into my house, and never stranger yet

				 				More welcome was than he. He was by birth

				 				Of Ithaca, he said, Laertes’ son,

				 				And grandson of Arcesias. Him I led

				 				Beneath my roof, and hospitably lodged,

				 				And feasted in the plenty of my home,

				 				And gave such gifts as might become a host﻿—

				 				Seven talents of wrought gold, a silver cup

				 				All over rough with flowers, twelve single cloaks,

				 				Twelve mats, twelve mantles passing beautiful,

				 				And tunics twelve, and, chosen by himself,

				 				Twelve graceful damsels, skilled in household arts.”



			 				And then his father answered, shedding tears:

				 				“Thou art indeed, O stranger, in the land

				 				Of which thou dost inquire, but wicked men

				 				And lawless now possess it. Thou hast given

				 				Thy generous gifts in vain; yet hadst thou found

				 				Ulysses living yet in Ithaca,

				 				Then would he have dismissed thee recompensed

				 				With gifts and liberal cheer, as is the due

				 				Of him who once has been our host. Yet say,

				 				And truly say, how many years have passed

				 				Since thou didst lodge my son, if he it was,

				 				Thy hapless guest, whom, far away from home

				 				And all his friends, the creatures of the deep,

				 				And the foul birds of air, and beasts of prey,

				 				Already have devoured. No mother mourned

				 				His death and wrapped him in his shroud, nor I,

				 				His father; nor did chaste Penelope,

				 				His consort nobly dowered, bewail the man

				 				She loved upon his bier with eyes dissolved

				 				In tears, as fitting was﻿—an honor due

				 				To those who die. Now, further, truly tell,

				 				For I would learn, what is thy name, and whence

				 				Thou comest, from what tribe, thy city where,

				 				And who thy parents. Where is the good ship

				 				At anchor which has brought thee and thy friends?

				 				Or hast thou landed from another’s barque,

				 				Which put thee on the shore and left the isle?”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:

				 				“I will tell all and truly. I am come

				 				From Alybas; a stately dwelling there

				 				Is mine, Apheidas is my father, son

				 				Of royal Polypemon, and my name

				 				Eperitus. Some deity has warped

				 				My course astray from the Sicanian coast,

				 				And brought me hitherward against my will.

				 				My barque lies yonder, stationed by the field

				 				Far from the city. This is the fifth year

				 				Since parting with me thy Ulysses left

				 				My native land for his, ill-fated man!

				 				Yet there were flights of birds upon the right

				 				Of happy presage as he sailed, and I

				 				Dismissed him cheerfully, and cheerfully

				 				He went. We hoped that we might yet become

				 				Each other’s guests, exchanging princely gifts.”



			 				He spake, and a dark cloud of sorrow came

				 				Over Laertes. With both hands he grasped

				 				The yellow dust, and over his white head

				 				Shed it with piteous groans. Ulysses felt

				 				His heart within him melted; the hot breath

				 				Rushed through his nostrils as he looked upon

				 				His well-beloved father, and he sprang

				 				And kissed and clasped him in his arms, and said:﻿—



			 				“Nay, I am he, my father; I myself

				 				Am he of whom thou askest. I am come

				 				To mine own country in the twentieth year.

				 				But calm thyself, refrain from tears, and grieve

				 				No more, and let me tell thee, in a word,

				 				I have slain all the suitors in my halls,

				 				And so avenged their insolence and crimes.”



			 				And then Laertes spake again, and said:

				 				“If now thou be Ulysses, my lost son,

				 				Give some plain token, that I may believe.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:

				 				“First, then, behold with thine own eyes the scar

				 				Which once the white tusk of a forest boar

				 				Inflicted on Parnassus, when I made

				 				The journey thither, by thy own command,

				 				And by my gracious mother’s, to receive

				 				Gifts which her father, King Autolycus,

				 				Once promised, when he came to Ithaca.

				 				And listen to me further; let me name

				 				The trees which in thy well-tilled orchard grounds

				 				Thou gavest me; I asked them all of thee,

				 				When by thy side I trod the garden walks,

				 				A little boy. We went among the trees,

				 				And thou didst name them. Of the pear thirteen,

				 				And of the apple ten thou gavest me,

				 				And forty fig-trees; and thou didst engage

				 				To give me fifty rows of vines, each row

				 				Of growth to feed the winepress. Grapes are there

				 				Of every flavor when the hours of Jove

				 				Shall nurse them into ripeness from on high.”



			 				He spake; a trembling seized the old man’s heart

				 				And knees, as he perceived how true were all

				 				The tokens which Ulysses gave. He threw

				 				Round his dear son his arms. The hardy chief,

				 				Ulysses, drew him fainting to his heart.

				 				But when the old man’s strength revived, and calm

				 				Came o’er his spirit, thus he spake again:﻿—



			 				“O father Jove, assuredly the gods

				 				Dwell on the Olympian height, since we behold

				 				The arrogant suitors punished for their crimes.

				 				Yet much I fear lest all the Ithacans

				 				Throng hither, and send messages to rouse

				 				Against us all the Cephallenian states.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:

				 				“Take courage; let no thought like that disturb

				 				Thy mind; but let us hasten to the house.

				 				Telemachus is there, with whom I sent

				 				The herdsman and the swineherd, bidding them

				 				Make ready with all speed our evening meal.”



			 				Thus talked the twain, and toward the dwelling took

				 				Their way, and entering the commodious rooms

				 				They found Telemachus, and by his side

				 				The herdsman and the keeper of the swine,

				 				Dividing for the feast the plenteous meats,

				 				And mingling the dark wine. Then to the bath

				 				Came the Sicilian dame, and ministered

				 				To the large-souled Laertes, and with oil

				 				Anointed him, and wrapped a sumptuous cloak

				 				About him. Pallas gave the monarch’s limbs

				 				An ampler roundness; taller to the sight

				 				He stood, and statelier. As he left the bath,

				 				His son beheld with wonder in his eyes,

				 				So like a god Laertes seemed, and thus

				 				Ulysses said to him in winged words:﻿—



			 				“Someone among the ever-living gods

				 				Hath surely shed, O father, on thy form

				 				And aspect all this grace and majesty.”



			 				The sage Laertes answered: “Father Jove,

				 				And Pallas and Apollo! would that I

				 				Were now as when I took the citadel

				 				Of Nericus, the strongly built, beside

				 				The seashore of Epirus, leading on

				 				My Cephallenians! With such strength as then,

				 				Armed for the fray, I would have met and fought

				 				The suitors in the palace yesterday,

				 				And struck down many lifeless in the hall,

				 				And greatly would thy spirit have rejoiced.”



			 				So talked they with each other. When they all

				 				Ceased from their task, and saw their meal prepared,

				 				They sat them down in order on the thrones

				 				And seats, and each put forth his hand and shared

				 				The banquet Now approached an aged man,

				 				Dolius, attended by his sons, who came

				 				Weary with toil, for the Sicilian dame,

				 				The nurse who reared them, went and summoned them﻿—

				 				She who in his late age with faithful care

				 				Cherished the father. These, when at the board

				 				They saw Ulysses, and knew who he was,

				 				Stopped in the hall astonished. Instantly

				 				Ulysses called to them with friendly words:﻿—



			 				“Sit at the board, old man; let none of you

				 				Give way to blank amazement. Know that we,

				 				Though keen our appetite for this repast,

				 				Have waited long, expecting your return.”



			 				He spake, and Dolius sprang with outstretched arms

				 				And seized Ulysses by the hand, and kissed

				 				The wrist; and thus in winged words he spake:﻿—



			 				“Dear master! since thou art returned to us,

				 				Who longed and yet expected not to see

				 				Thy face again﻿—since some divinity

				 				Has led thee hither﻿—hail! and great may be

				 				Thy happiness, and may the gods bestow

				 				All blessings on thee! But declare, for I

				 				Would gladly know, if sage Penelope

				 				Have heard the tidings yet of thy return,

				 				Or must we send them by a messenger.”



			 				Ulysses, the sagacious, answered thus:

				 				“My aged friend, she knows already all.

				 				Why wouldst thou take that care upon thyself?”



			 				He spake, and Dolius on a polished seat

				 				Sat down, but round the great Ulysses came

				 				His sons, and welcomed him with loving words,

				 				And hung upon his hand, and then they took

				 				Their places by their father. So they sat

				 				Beneath Laertes’ roof, and banqueted.



			 				Now through the city meantime swiftly ran

				 				The rumor that the suitors all had met

				 				A bloody death. No sooner had men heard

				 				The tidings than they came with cries and moans

				 				Before the palace, moving to and fro.

				 				Each carried forth his dead, and gave to each

				 				His funeral rites, except to those who came

				 				From distant cities; these they put on board

				 				Swift-sailing galleys of the fishermen,

				 				That they might bear them home. And then they came

				 				Sorrowing together in the marketplace.

				 				There, when the assembly now was full, arose

				 				Eupeithes and addressed them. In his heart

				 				Was sorrow, that could never be consoled,

				 				For his slain son Antinoüs, who was first

				 				To fall before Ulysses. Weeping rose

				 				The father, and harangued the assembly thus:﻿—



			 				“Great things, indeed, my friends, hath this man done

				 				For us Achaians. Many valiant men

				 				He gathered in his ships and led abroad,

				 				And lost his gallant ships, and lost his men

				 				And now, returning, he has put to death

				 				The best of all the Cephallenian race.

				 				Come, then, and ere he find a safe retreat

				 				In Pylos, or in hallowed Elis, where

				 				The Epeians rule, pursue him; endless shame

				 				Will be our portion else, and they who live

				 				In future years will hear of our disgrace.

				 				If we avenge not on these men of blood

				 				The murder of our sons and brothers, life

				 				Will not be sweet to me, and I would go

				 				At once, and gladly, down among the dead.

				 				Rise, then, and fall upon them ere they flee.”



			 				So spake he, weeping; and the Greeks were moved

				 				With pity as they heard him. Now appeared

				 				The herald Medon and the sacred bard,

				 				As, rising from the sleep of night, they left

				 				The palace of Ulysses. They stood forth

				 				Amid the multitude, who all beheld

				 				With wonder. Then sagacious Medon spake:﻿—



			 				“Give ear, ye men of Ithaca, and know

				 				That not without the approval of the gods

				 				Ulysses hath done this. I saw, myself,

				 				One of the immortals taking part with him,

				 				In all things like to Mentor. Now the god

				 				Standing before Ulysses strengthened him

				 				For combat, and now drove the routed band

				 				Of suitors through the hall; in heaps they fell.”



			 				He spake, and all who heard were pale with fear.

				 				The aged hero, Halitherses, son

				 				Of Mastor, then came forward; he alone

				 				Knew what was past and what was yet to come,

				 				And, wisely judging, to the assembly said:﻿—



			 				“Hear now my words, ye men of Ithaca.

				 				Through your own wrong all this has come to pass.

				 				To me ye would not hearken, nor obey

				 				When Mentor, shepherd of the people, spake.

				 				On the mad doings of your sons ye put

				 				No curb, nor checked the guilty insolence

				 				That dared to waste the substance and insult

				 				The consort of a man of eminent worth,

				 				Who, so they thought, would nevermore return.

				 				Now be it as I counsel; let us not

				 				Go forth to draw down evil on our heads.”



			 				He spake; but more than half the assembly rushed

				 				Abroad with shouts; the others kept their place

				 				Together. Ill the augur’s speech had pleased

				 				The most. Eupeithes had persuaded them.

				 				They flew to arms, and when they had put on

				 				The glittering brass, they mustered in close ranks

				 				Before the spacious city. At their head

				 				Eupeithes led them on, who madly deemed

				 				Himself the avenger of his slaughtered son.

				 				Yet he from that encounter nevermore

				 				Was to return; his fate o’ertook him there.



			 				Then Pallas thus addressed Saturnian Jove:

				 				“Our Father, son of Saturn, king of kings,

				 				Tell me, I pray, the purpose of thy heart

				 				Yet unrevealed. Shall there be cruel war

				 				And deadly combats, or wilt thou ordain

				 				That these shall henceforth dwell in amity?”



			 				And cloud-compelling Jove made answer thus:

				 				“My child, why ask me? Was it not with thee

				 				A cherished purpose, that, returning home,

				 				Ulysses amply should avenge himself

				 				Upon the suitors? Do, then, as thou wilt.

				 				Yet this, as the most fitting, I advise.

				 				Now that the great Ulysses has avenged

				 				His wrongs, let there be made a faithful league

				 				With oaths, and let Ulysses ever reign;

				 				And we will cause the living to forget

				 				Their sons and brothers slain, and all shall dwell

				 				In friendship as they heretofore have dwelt,

				 				And there shall be prosperity and peace.”



			 				He spake, and eager as she was before,

				 				Encouraged by his words, the goddess plunged

				 				Down from the summits of the Olympian mount

				 				Now when they all had feasted to the full,

				 				The much-enduring chief, Ulysses, said:

				 				“Go, one of you, and see if they are near.”



			 				He spake; a son of Dolius at his word

				 				Went forth, and, coming to the threshold, stopped.

				 				He saw them all at hand, and instantly

				 				Bespake Ulysses thus, with winged words:

				 				“They are upon us; we must arm at once.”



			 				He spake; they rose, and quickly were in arms.

				 				Four were Ulysses and his friends, and six

				 				The sons of Dolius. Old Laertes then,

				 				And Dolius, put on armor with the rest,

				 				Gray-headed as they were, for now their aid

				 				Was needed. When they all had clad themselves

				 				In shining brass, they threw the portals wide

				 				And sallied forth, Ulysses at their head.



			 				Now Pallas, daughter of almighty Jove,

				 				Drew near them. She had taken Mentor’s form

				 				And Mentor’s voice. The much-enduring chief,

				 				Ulysses, saw her and rejoiced, and said

				 				To his beloved son, Telemachus:﻿—



			 				“Now wilt thou, of thyself, Telemachus,

				 				Bethink thee, when thou minglest in the fray

				 				That tries men’s valor, not to cast disgrace

				 				Upon thy forefathers﻿—a race renowned

				 				For manly daring over all the earth.”



			 				And thus discreet Telemachus replied:

				 				“Nay, if thou wilt, my father, thou shalt see

				 				That by no lack of valor shall I cast,

				 				As thou hast said, dishonor on thy race.”



			 				Laertes heard them, and rejoiced, and said:

				 				“O what a day for me, ye blessed gods,

				 				Is this! With what delight I see my son

				 				And grandson rivals on the battlefield.”



			 				And then the blue-eyed Pallas, drawing near

				 				Laertes, said: “Son of Arcesias, loved

				 				By me beyond all others of my friends,

				 				Pray to Jove’s blue-eyed daughter, and to Jove,

				 				And brandish thy long spear, and send it forth.”



			 				So Pallas spake, and breathed into his frame

				 				Strength irresistible. The aged chief

				 				Prayed to the daughter of almighty Jove,

				 				And brandished his long spear and sent it forth.

				 				It smote Eupeithes on the helmet’s cheek.

				 				The brass stayed not the spear, the blade passed through,

				 				And heavily Eupeithes fell to earth,

				 				His armor clashing round him as he fell.

				 				Then rushed Ulysses and his valiant son

				 				Forward, the foremost of their band, and smote

				 				Their foes with swords and lancet double-edged,

				 				And would have struck them down to rise no more,

				 				If Pallas, daughter of the god who bears

				 				The aegis, had not with a mighty voice

				 				Commanded all the combatants to cease:﻿—



			 				“Stay, men of Ithaca; withhold your hands

				 				From deadly combat. Part, and shed no blood.”



			 				So Pallas spake, and they grew pale with awe,

				 				And fear-struck; as they heard her words they dropped

				 				Their weapons all upon the earth. They fled

				 				Townward as if for life, while terribly

				 				The much-enduring chief Ulysses raised

				 				His voice, and shouted after them, and sprang

				 				Upon them as an eagle darts through air.

				 				Then Saturn’s son sent down a bolt of fire;

				 				It fell before his blue-eyed daughter’s feet,

				 				And thus the goddess to Ulysses called:﻿—



			 				“Son of Laertes, nobly born and wise,

				 				Ulysses, hold thy hand; restrain the rage

				 				Of deadly combat, lest the god who wields

				 				The thunder, Saturn’s son, be wroth with thee.”



			 				She spake, and gladly he obeyed; and then

				 				Pallas, the child of aegis-bearing Jove,

				 				Plighted, in Mentor’s form with Mentor’s voice,

				 				A covenant of peace between the foes.
